1	/startup-idea/startup-failures	You can learn a lot from failures of others. What if there was a website where people shared their startup failures so others can learn from that. Maybe you could get some money for posting your own analysis of your failure and other entrepreneurs might pay to get access to it	2019-09-10 16:58:43.12624
2	/startup-idea/graphical-restaurant-reservation-system	A reservation system for pubs and restaurants that would allow you to see a graphical layout of the establishment. You would see what tables are available at what times and you'd be able to book a specific table for a specific time.  You could do it on the web or using a mobile app without needing to call the restaurant. You can pick your seats on a plane, why not a restaurant?	2019-09-10 16:58:43.12624
3	/startup-idea/examcrazy-for-the-students-by-the-students	A virtual study room where students can meet other students of their own disciplines and prepare for their exams. Give a pop quiz for your friends, rate them, develop ideas over a concept and much more. Initially i thought this idea for a Facebook App. But now i am thinking this has a website.\nStudies show over 65% of FBook users are under the age of 24. Why cant we use Social Networking for the sake of Academics.	2019-09-10 16:58:43.12624
4	/startup-idea/qwikly---skip-the-line-at-supermarkets	Qwikly is an app that will revolutionize the way you shop at supermarkets, department stores or any other stores. The app allows the user to scan product barcodes with their phones, when the user is ready to check out, just press the 'check out' button and the total amount is automatically paid electronically. A Qwikly account is linked to your debit or credit card so you won't have to line up again. Just scan, pay with the press of a button and you are good to go!\n\nQwikly is currently under development, but if you are interested in being a part of our team, our door is always open!	2019-09-10 16:58:43.12624
5	/startup-idea/html-5-gaming-website	Lots of games are coming with html5 and they are really cool. Lets build a website that will be full of html5 cool games.	2019-09-10 16:58:43.12624
6	/startup-idea/city-parking-finder	It's really frustrating trying to find a free place to park in the middle of the city. Would be great to have a mobile app that could show you free spots around. Could be based on public webcams, data from parking lots or maybe people can somehow show click in the app they are leaving the spot so someone else can come. Tough to keep it real time though.	2019-09-10 16:58:43.12624
7	/startup-idea/education-stocks	The idea is to make highly intelligent and gifted but underprivileged high school students into a tradable asset. Something similar to an IPO is issued and a certain amount of shares are issued that can be purchased as an investment or bought and sold for speculation. The money is then used directly to pay for a university. Any activity and awards achieved while in school will move the share value of the person. Upon completion of the college and getting a job, the person has the option of buying back their shares from the public completely or partially after a few years. This can also work for musicians, artists, or athletes.	2019-09-10 16:58:43.12624
8	/startup-idea/things-before-i-die-social-list	A list of 100 things you want to do before you die. Allright this is not a very creative idea but, how about doing that social? You can create a page that you can customize, get friends connected to share your page, copy your items, help you to mark done items and get suggestions. Also a marketplace would help you realize the goal by matching local business that offer services to help you get things done.	2019-09-10 16:58:43.12624
9	/startup-idea/phone-in-the-cloud	When my battery is gone or I don't have a signal I want to connect to the internet and use my phone virtually - receive sms, write new ones, see missed calls etc. Anyone interested in doing that for every phone?	2019-09-10 16:58:43.12624
10	/startup-idea/car-sharing-realtime-mobile-app	I would like to have mobile app which will help me to fill my car by people (co-riders) if I go somewhere. We can share costs, be eco and meet new people.\nThere are car-sharing and ride-sharing services available but none of them is real-time.\n\nOn the other side - if you need to get somewhere e.g. commuting to work why not to jump in someone's car, share costs, get comfortable ride and be faster compared to buses or trains.\n\nApp could work globally and provide only local based search result of ride seekers and drivers.\n\nHow do you like it? Contact me on @kotyzap if you want more info. \n\nHave a great day and greetings from beautiful Czech Republic.	2019-09-10 16:58:43.12624
11	/startup-idea/connect-young-scientists-and-businesses	Hi guys,\n\nI am working on a project which aim is to connect scientists and businesses. Science in the Czech Republic  is underfinanced (I believe in other countries too) so young smart minds are forced to look for patrons or commercial ventures to support their research. We are trying to create a simple but visually appealing site that allows them to present themselves in a professional way so the potential donors can come to a single site. Do you know about any similar project in your country? Would you like to join our team?	2019-09-10 16:58:43.12624
12	/startup-idea/bill-splitting-for-roommates	Bill splitting can sometimes be a complex task. How much is the bill this month? Wait, what percentage of water do I pay? Why not simplify the process? \n\nWith a function similar to Mint.com which allows you to link up your utilities and any relevant bills. Thus, when all bills come in, an email is sent to all roommates. Could be useful in other contexts, like a fraternity house or other group living situation where the roommates change. \n\nYou could improve the process by allowing everyone to pay their portion online and avoid the whole (who wants to write the big check issue). \n\nThis concept could be applied in a variety of situations and could be developed into an iphone app for paying for a trip.	2019-09-10 16:58:43.12624
13	/startup-idea/my-dreams-list	Social mobile network about your dreams. What do you want to do in your life, where do you plan to go, your secret ideas. \nSocial network join same people with same dreams, ideas and plan you want to do in your life.

You can store photos, videos, quotes, text/stories, etc (personal data that's important to you) in a location on the site called a vault. You can then choose privacy settings such as "Private" or "Public." You can then set a time for the vault to be opened at, and that is the only time that this data will be shared, and you can also pick certain people that the data will be shared with. When the date comes for the vault to be opened an email will be sent to those who are capable of seeing the contents and those users could see everything in the vault. You could also set the vault to be just opened by you, and you will then receive an email when it's ready to be opened and then you can see everything stored in it. Its basically a digital time capsule with "Social Features."\nWant to join the project? Send me a message!	2019-09-10 16:58:43.12624
16	/startup-idea/time-barter	Everyone is good at something. How about a website that would allow time barter - I will program 2 hours anything for somebody if he/she helps me for 2 hours with painting my flat. Everyone then can do what he loves and everything gets done.	2019-09-10 16:58:49.22829
17	/startup-idea/pocketbook---say-goodbye-to-paper-receipts	Receipts.\n\nSome people keep them in their wallets\nSome people keep them in shoeboxes\nMost people are frustrated with keeping them organized.\nIt gets worse when you are looking for this one particular receipt as you go through piles of paper receipts. \n\nThese paper receipts are messy, they are a hassle to deal with and they make it difficult to keep track of your expenses.\n\nWell Pocketbook solves your problems.

19	/startup-idea/food-wastage-reduction-through-donation	Across the world, there are restaurants that waste tons of excess food everyday. I would like to create a website/iphone/android app to establish a link between restaurants and the charity homes/needy households to enable excess food donation. We can also create a 'goodwill' points system for restaurants to get rewarded for such a noble deed which they can use for their own marketing efforts by being a responsible social business as well.	2019-09-10 16:58:49.22829
20	/startup-idea/app-telling-visitors-of-things-to-do-in-your-area	An app to find out the best places to go and things to do in a place you're visiting provided by people who live there or have been before.  Discover new places you may not find in a traditional "things to do book". This can be international or domestic.	2019-09-10 16:58:49.22829
21	/startup-idea/dont-eat-alone	First, while there are many nice friendly people around us we barely get a chance to talk to them and get to know them, because we’re too busy or shy to initiate a conversation, among other reasons. Second, I observed that many students eat by themselves on campus. Combining these two, I thought that a third party (the app) inviting people to eat together can tackle both these problems.\nThe app works this way: you tell it your whereabouts, your schedule (the time you usually eat), and who like to eat with (age, gender, etc.). Then each day the app matches you with someone who meets your criteria, finds a restaurant/cafe nearby and a time convenient to your schedule, and sends you (and your match) an invitation to eat together which you can either accept or reject.\nI've already implemented the idea and you're welcome to join:\nwww.friendesque.com	2019-09-10 16:58:49.22829
22	/startup-idea/flirt-alert	An app that automatically imports your friends list from facebook or other social network, and you can rank your friends in attractiveness (Would sleep with, would date, hot,somewhat attractive, best friend, normal friend, repulsivie) anonymously. Your 'stats' will remain private and If two people rate each other as "would date" or "would sleep with", both will be informed.	2019-09-10 16:58:49.22829
23	/startup-idea/mobile-app-for-catching-bus	I hate that moment when you see your bus leaving right in front of you and then have to wait for 15 minutes in the cold. I would like to have a mobile app that would tell you every 30 s or 1 minute: "Your bus is leaving in 4 minutes, next one goes after another 15", so I can decide whether it makes sense to run now or wait for the next one	2019-09-10 16:58:49.22829
24	/startup-idea/application-for-recording-your-goals-and-habits	Web applications where you choose or you create your goal or habit and you will record your progress.

25	/startup-idea/ubercom-idea-for-mom-cooking	\nI was reading uber.com story recently; basically it turns everyone into a taxi driver.  I was thinking of this uber.com idea, the core elements are: (a) a guy with a skill of driving and a car, (b)customer who needs this skill, (c) aggregate all of ‘a’ and ‘b’ in one platform. \n\nAs you are the entrepreneur in mind, a great idea can use in the similar but different market. Then, I was thinking of a mom cooking for your dinner model. Here is the idea.\n\nProblem: You all agree that for busy career women, it’s really hard to prepare dinner after work. There are problems and entrepreneurs are aiming to solve. \n\nSolution: There are already many mom who are preparing for their kids dinner. Why not just cook additional more for the customer?\na. For people who are already preparing for their home dinner. In other word, anyone who can cook, they can come to this MomCook.com (example). The site will show case the nicely photo of the dishes each chef served (like airbnb.com).\nb. Career women can just go to the web, order prefer dinner cooking. Pick up the dinner of the chief’s home in the evening, and enjoy a home cooking meal.	2019-09-10 16:58:49.22829

27	/startup-idea/crowdsourced-start-up-development---revenue-share	Every start-up company have 3 big problems. The first one is detailed description and review of business concept / model, second one is no money or time, and third is realization, which is in 90% cases sw development.

There are many rules that can define what exactly revenue share is, and how much of it will be given to each of developers. What do you think ?	2019-09-10 16:58:49.22829

Anyone who is interested in doing this with me? Please ping me.	2019-09-10 16:58:49.22829
29	/startup-idea/learning-from-your-peers	A friend and I came up with this idea yesterday. Basically, everyone has a special skill, hobby, or passion that excites them, right? Why not provide a way for people to share their knowledge in the form of teaching classes. People would be able to create and organize classes based on their expertise and charge a small fee for entry. Classes could be held anywhere locally (coffee shop, etc) or even online in a group video chat type of format. This would be a pretty cool way to explore new interests, learn new skills, meet people with similar hobbies/skills, and earn a few extra bucks on the side from sharing things you already enjoy!\n\nIf anyone is interested in partnering up on this idea I'd be really interested to hear from you!	2019-09-10 16:58:49.22829

31	/startup-idea/help-choosing-career---work---occupation	I think most of people have real problem while choosing career or life path. The site would help to make decision. In a nutshell - idea is that there will be two types of users - ones who seeks for advice and those who will help to make decision.

32	/startup-idea/web-development-team-creator	You are a developer, but you don't have web design skills, or you could be a web designer but you don't know much about web programming.  Maybe you and your partners are a great technical team but you don't have sales.  \n\nI think its time to have a tool where you can create or join a Web Development Team. \n\nThis will be an online  tool for to create or join web development companies. You can upload a video resume of 2 Minute duration , one minute for talking about your who you are and what you are looking for (here you will show your english level) and the other minute to talk about your skill set, and job experience. An example could be :  \n\n1) Branchcore Web Team  has 1 Web PHP Developer(Colorado), 2 Web Designers (Japan) and 1 sales representative(California). \n\n2) SmarChunk Web Team has 1 Rails Developer(UK), 1 Python Developer(Mexico), 1 Web Designer(New England), 1 IT Manager/Sales(California).\n\nThe goal is to create a truly great web development company.	2019-09-10 16:58:51.75714
33	/startup-idea/game-ified-english-learning-app	The problem is that the cost of ESL service is about 2500-4000 USD per month in countries such as UAE and KSA. Furthermore, ESL content is outdated and boring. Lastly, ESL speakers are required to learn the most advanced grammar rules that most English speakers don't recognize.\n\nSolution is to create game-ified English learning apps with a subscription model where users get access to real live teachers for 30-60 minutes per day. The modules in the app would only include relevant English phrases and sentences which users would need in a certain environment.	2019-09-10 16:58:51.75714

39	/startup-idea/toy-swap-app	Hi,\n\nWe have a 9 month old son and have been getting toys for our son from friends and families.  It's obvious that infants outgrow their toys quickly and parents always have to get new toys for them.

So how about a location-based app that shows nearby parents that are interested in toy exchange and post pictures of toys and their condition?	2019-09-10 16:58:51.75714
40	/startup-idea/crowdfunding-for-schools-in-czech-republic	Many czech schools lack funding to run interesting events for the kids or to renew the equipment faster, etc. Parents are not willing to spend huge amounts of money contributing directly and also do not have the full trust in the school management.	2019-09-10 16:58:51.75714

45	/startup-idea/person-for-person-shopping-shipping-worldwide	I miss some stuff from Australia, expats in Europe miss their US merchandise such as "cookies", "mustard", etc. Why not to have service all around the world which will provide "Shop anywhere & Send Anywhere".\n\nExample: UGG Shoes costs AUD100 in Sydney and 400USD in Europe. Why not to have someone who will buy me these in Sydney and send via normal post to Europe. Of course incl. some "fee for purchasing" and of course all on pre-paid basis.\n\nDo you miss Vegemite when living abroad? Do you want me to buy you iTunes gift card and send you code via email? This is exactly what is the service for.\n\nDo you like this idea? Need more info? Contact me @kotyzap	2019-09-10 16:58:53.628848
46	/startup-idea/mentorship-program-for-recent-college-graduates	My idea is to create a mentorship program for unemployed or underemployed recent college graduates. This opportunity would provide companies with verifiable, competent, and driven employees.\n\n Recent graduates would have access to lead people from reputable companies from and array of industries. This mentorship program would encourage the continuous circulation of fresh and innovative ideas within companies. \n\nMentors would select mentees based on unique portfolios that showcase how their skills and education would enhance the company’s objectives.\n\n Each mentee would present an innovative idea that would enhance the companies: economic, social or technological growth.  Mentees will be given the opportunity to integrate their ideas with the mentor’s consent and guidance. \n\nMentors will create living wage internships for mentee.  Mentees will agree to work with the mentor’s company for 9 months or other agreed upon time frame and in-turn will train their successor. \n\nAt the duration of the mentorship program mentees will be given the opportunity to obtain employment or assistantship within the company.  \n\n\n\n\n	2019-09-10 16:58:53.628848

48	/startup-idea/app-for-tracking-who-owes-who-money	My friends and I are always forgetting if we have paid each other back and who owes who what amount for concerts, dinners, etc.\n\nWas thinking of an app that you can select from your contacts / facebook friends, who owe you money or that you owe money too. This will include what amount is owing and a reminder of when to pay by.\n\nSometimes it can be awkward asking particular people for money so the app can send reminders to pay if haven't done so by the due date.\n\nYou can then pay through the app using something like Paypal api. \n	2019-09-10 16:58:53.628848
49	/startup-idea/message-in-a-bottle	How romantic is the concept of a "Message in a Bottle?"<br><br>How about if there was some kind of digital service like this.<br>People can put their Messages (text, photos, videos) in a "bottle" and send it out to the world. On the other side, people receive the messages and can decide to either (A) keep the message or (B) throw it back. If a message gets discarded more than x times it would be transferred into a "unwanted" messages area.<br><br>Once you decide to keep that message, it's yours, nobody else can receive/see it. You can find out more about the person who sent out the "bottle" and decide if you want to send back a message (or not).<br><br>Probably have to get more into detail.<br><br>Im thinking Snapchat meets ThumbsUp meets Chatroulette... ish.	2019-09-10 16:58:53.628848
50	/startup-idea/grocery-delivery	I'd like to make an app/website that is similar to Uber/Lyft, but with groceries. There are a lot of times where I need something from the grocery store, but have worked all day and don't feel like getting out and buying a few groceries. How convenient would it be to log into the app, select the nearest delivery agent and submit your grocery list?\n\nUsers would browse items from the app and add them to their grocery list (with pictures to limit confusion).\n\nThe agent would then receive a notification on his/her phone, choose whether or not to accept the job, then pick up the groceries on the list and make the delivery.	2019-09-10 16:58:53.628848
51	/startup-idea/instant-book-reviews	When I am buying book (usually as a gift) I need to go through titles I never heard about. It's quite difficult to decide which one is good. Would be great if I can just take a picture of the cover with my mobile phone and it would instantly show me real time reviews from the readers (via Amazon or something). Could also show prices in different stores too.	2019-09-10 16:58:53.628848
52	/startup-idea/brand-recognizer	I am quite lost in the shopping malls with all the brands. How about creating an app that would show you more details about the brand just by pointing your phone camera to the company logo. Ideally with some references from customers.	2019-09-10 16:58:53.628848
53	/startup-idea/augmented-reality-for-shopping-clothes-online	To develop a solution for an online shopping plattforms that would integrate in the product detail accept your picture and work with your physical proportions to show you exactly how the piece of a cloth would fit you. Everything using an augmented reality.	2019-09-10 16:58:53.628848
111	/startup-idea/visualizing-service-on-demand	I work a lot with various data which I need to present for my clients. I can create the presentation myself, but what I need is a stunning way to visualize the data - in nice animation, graph beyond Excel charts or anything else to emphasize my idea. I have already analyse the data, know what I want to say, but I lack the skills to visualize it in a special way. Could be great to have a service where I send it, they analyze which form suits the most and then send it back to me ideally within 24 hours.	2019-09-10 16:58:59.818875

54	/startup-idea/online-weight-loss-competition-platform	Wouldn't it be nice to have a complete platform and resources for people to organize weight loss competitions in their local area? The idea isn't really unique because I know there are some websites out there that offer this similar idea but I think there are a lot of potentials in making it better and more fun. I can see there's a lot of demand for people to lose weight, especially in the U.S. and at the same time making extra money on the side. The idea is to create a site where people can create a competition and other people can join in. They can set the contribution fee themselves and the duration of the contest. Every 2 weeks or so, each participant is required to check in so everyone knows where they're at in the progress. Let me know what you guys think about this idea!	2019-09-10 16:58:53.628848
55	/startup-idea/storyteller-app	Connecting people to create and come up with stories from across the globe. \n\nEveryone is a storyteller. A story is started by a person in the main storyboard and other members of the app can add their story lines in order to continue the story. The catch is, only 50 words allowed per user. Stories of different genres will be present and one story of maximum 500 words.	2019-09-10 16:58:53.628848
56	/startup-idea/social-networking-app-for-people-with-a-life	Basically it is a mobile social networking app that connects a very limited number of people (like may be around 10-15). Obviously, it could be used to share information with each other. But the USP of this app is activities that helps you to easily create meet-ups or similar activities.\n \nFor example, you could easily create an activity like ‘meet-up for coffee’ or ’meet-up for a drink’ and the app will display different coffee shops/pubs nearby or distant. You just choose one and select the friends that you want to go out with. And the friends will get the notification on their phone/tablet with the location and time. Now, they can either accept or decline to join.\n \nSimilarly for a movie/game as well. The app will show nearby theaters/films running or scheduled games and you can easily plan a program and book tickets.  \n \nAnother feature that I’m thinking about is a random event generator. Like if you have no idea what to do, touch the screen and the app will create a plan for you according to your group’s preferences.	2019-09-10 16:58:53.628848
57	/startup-idea/mobile-app-for-voice-to-voice-translation	I am eagerly waiting for a device that could instantly translate conversation of two people. Would be great for travelling or just meeting foreigners.	2019-09-10 16:58:53.628848
58	/startup-idea/lets-talk-together	I've been learning English and need to improve spoken English. My spoken English is terrible. I've tried contacted people around the world many times for improving our spoken english but it usually doesn't work ( because of you have too diferent level of english, the second person isn't interested in speak to you, you don't have topic to be discussed and so on) So I've been thinking about some free website where some topics would be given and you can freely join to any and start speak to group. If you realize that the topic is not right for you or level of English is too difficult or to easy, you just leave the group and join to another whenever you have time to speak you can join to this website and start to speak. You don't need to add any person to you contact list, you don't need to thinkig about topic, you don't need to search for people who's the same interest like you, everything you'll find on this website. I made some mockup http://worldcup2010.webz.cz/LetsTalkTogether.pdf	2019-09-10 16:58:55.378691
59	/startup-idea/crime-heat-map-for-travelers	I travel quite a lot and especially in developing countries it is difficult to say which areas should I avoid because of danger. Could be great if there was up-to-date heatmap of danger. Usually it is not that the whole country or whole city is dangerous.It is mostly some local spots. Would be great if police or other travellers could report they experience.	2019-09-10 16:58:55.378691
60	/startup-idea/international-mobile-payment-service	How about a service like PayPal but via mobile phones so you can pay by sending sms from any country in the world. Lot of people don't have PayPal account or credit cards activated for internet payments or they are concerned about safety of the transactions. Sending sms is simple and safe. The provisions need to be reasonable though so the shops can afford it.	2019-09-10 16:58:55.378691
61	/startup-idea/crowdsourced-beta-testing	It is difficult to find people from your target audience willing to test your product. Would be great to have a database of people willing to do the testing so I can just simply check what kind of people I need. Something similar to marketing polls.	2019-09-10 16:58:55.378691
62	/startup-idea/neighborhood-sport-connections	Have you ever been at home by yourself wanting to play a team sport but you have no one to play with. What about a social application that links people in your area together to so you could play a social game of sport? Say you wanted to have a game of soccer, you could go onto the site/application type in soccer in my area and a list of local games or people interested in playing would come up on the screen. Money could be made by attaining sponsorship from sporting companies.	2019-09-10 16:58:55.378691
63	/startup-idea/crowdsourced-audio-guides-for-tourists	A platform/service where anyone can create audio guides - relatively short audio files on different cities and places in them.  They could be thematic, e.g. poetic, funny, informative, historic etc. Users can download them and use while travelling or listen directly  from the web depending on mobile internet prices and users. People wouldn't have to pay for those boring standard audio guides that are available in most touristic places anymore.	2019-09-10 16:58:55.378691
64	/startup-idea/local-ideaswatch	I want to know what people miss in a specific location around me. It doesn't have to be anything brilliantly innovative, just something regular that isn't at that specific spot. Let's say people could vote for a new grocery shop in the neighborhood.	2019-09-10 16:58:55.378691
65	/startup-idea/fake-at-party-app	I need an app that can create background noise (loud music, people talking, etc) during a call. It would be great to fake traffic and many other situations. I really need this when my ex calls so I can pretend I'm out having fun on my ANDROID. Maybe get financed at http://www.appbackr.com/	2019-09-10 16:58:55.378691
66	/startup-idea/small-local-paid-work-in-your-area	If your bored and have alot of time and are in need of some quick cash, just whip out your phone, click on this app and see what people in your neighborhood or in your coty need done. Maybe someone a few blocks down need someone to walk their dog once a week. Or maybe they need you to mow their lawn. Or even just need a carwash, but are too lazy to do it. Small things that could take a day could be on one page. And weekend projects could be on another. The pay would be listed next to the project name along with description after you click on it.	2019-09-10 16:58:55.378691

68	/startup-idea/intelligent-domain-name-generator	I often spend hours trying to find out cool and available domain name for my website. There are some services to generate domain name, but it's usually lame - just random number or word added to the end. What I am looking for is an intelligent generator - that would automatically find synonyms and related words that are actually really usable and meaningful.	2019-09-10 16:58:55.378691

70	/startup-idea/online-market	An online marketplace with a twist. Unlike ebay, craigslist, gumtree etc. Consider a traditional market place. People come, set up stalls for the day or only a few hours and sell. Take this idea to the online world. people can pay for "stalls" virtual online ones to host a number of products they want to sell. What will make this site different is that the entire content of the site will constantly be changing, the sellers changing, everything changing. people will be drawn to the site daily because of all the new additions, things that they might not ever find again.\n\nRevenue could be produced either by charging sellers or through advertising.\n\nAny ideas?	2019-09-10 16:58:55.378691
71	/startup-idea/public-printing-machines	Why not to have printing machines on every corner just like ATMs or vending machines. You could just insert a flash drive or send something via Bluetooth and it gets printed for reasonable price right on the street. Useful for printing photos or just notes from your mobile phone.	2019-09-10 16:58:55.378691
72	/startup-idea/simple-advertisement-on-toilet-paper	A company providing simple advertisement print on toilet paper which is then distributed throughout public toilets at large complexes such as shopping centers, cinemas, etc.\n\nWhether we like it or not we do notice print on toilet paper ! :-)	2019-09-10 16:58:57.213048
73	/startup-idea/meeting-compatible-people-mobile-app	imagine a mobile app that scans your proximity, say 30 meters, for people who have created a profile with some service, lets call it MYMAIL. this mobile app then compares your "likes" to their "likes". then, if you find a person with compatibility of say 80% or higher, you can add the person as a contact. anonymous, you can then send a message to people you really know are compatible and happen to be in your region at least sometimes.	2019-09-10 16:58:57.213048
74	/startup-idea/web-application-for-finding-team	This is web application which will be used for local competition in informatics. After the competition I would love to improve the application and make it  usable for the general public. This web application would work this way: everyone can register and make a profile on it. You can state your personal information and projects you would like to work on as well as projects you have already finished. People can look over your projects and contact you about working on a specific project, give you some advice, even donations. After every succesful project, we would make sure that it gets to the market easily. \n\nI guess someone could help me with this :)	2019-09-10 16:58:57.213048
75	/startup-idea/social-network-that-pays-you	So the idea is to build a social network kind of like Facebook where friends and family can integrate with each other. The tweak is that members can earn money by for example viewing ads, completing surveys etc. If they refer friends and family they earn money on their activity, too. It's a site where people can earn a few hundred bucks a month or even a few thousands if they are motivated enough to refer friends and family.\n\nWhen they log on they will instantly be directed to the ads and surveys of the day.\n\nIt'll be free for people to join. People always appreciate a few hundreds in their pockets each month.\n\nWe could put up ads from different PPC networks, affiliate networks, adwords etc. Some keywords on adwords pay upwards $10 per click. Later on we could talk to companies that might want to put ads up on the site.\n\nI need partners that are good with developing and designing websites like this, someone who's good in SEO. I'm good in marketing so I do that.\n\nHopefully you guys think it's a good idea.	2019-09-10 16:58:57.213048
76	/startup-idea/social-travel	I would like to help travelers meet others travelling in the same time and location. That is, I just would like to Increase serendipity in our trip.\n\nOur users can choose when and which city to travel, and then they can find out other travellers who planning to travel the same city in the same date.\n\n	2019-09-10 16:58:57.213048

Somebody do it at least for Europe when it changes quickly when you are passing several countries in a few hours.	2019-09-10 16:58:57.213048
80	/startup-idea/homeless-food-and-accommodation-cards-coupons	One of the greatest dilemmas with giving money to the poor is not being able to control what they spend it on. Often i don't give homeless people money because i think they will just spend it on alcohol or drugs. The coupons work just like a store gift card, you purchase the card from a supermarket or homeless hostel and then give it to someone thats homeless.	2019-09-10 16:58:57.213048
113	/startup-idea/donate-work-instead-of-money	Build an online platform where people can donate work instead of money. NGOs who are in need of technical help (like build a website, maintenance, bug fixes etc) can post their work on this platform and people willing to help them can donate few hours of work for them.\n\nVarious benefits of this platform\n- NGOs who cannot afford to spend can benefit by this\n- NGOs who are not aware of online presence and its benefits\n- Donation satisfaction to people who donate work through this platform\n\nNGOs will need to provide certifications to validate that they are indeed a NGO before they are allowed to post work on this platform.\n\nPlatform will not make any money for itself except show ads and earn money to run the platform itself.\n	2019-09-10 16:58:59.818875
81	/startup-idea/make-sugarcane-juice-available-to-the-world	Sugarcane juice available to the world\n\nIn some countries, there is a delicious beverage called sugarcane juice and whoever has already tried it, never forgets its flavor. Unlike you may think, it is not unhealthy as the over-processed white sugar as it contains considerable amounts of minerals, vitamins and proteins. However, it has to be consumed right after it is extracted from the sugarcane, and this is why it is not sold in bottles. It is commonly sold in trucks or stands, since it is needed a machine to grind the sugarcane. \n\nMy idea is to make sugarcane juice available to the biggest cities and touristic spots in the world, setting up a franchise business that sells the appropriate equipments and indicates the raw material vendors.\n\nThis beverage is popular mainly in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Thailand, China, Caribbean, Egypt. I am sure there is still plenty of market to explore.	2019-09-10 16:58:57.213048
82	/startup-idea/internet-operating-system	Applications on internet are very isolated and cannot share informations easily. It would be great to create web application I call internet operating system which would be system for centralized data management of other web applications. Everything could be on cloud and computer would be just client.	2019-09-10 16:58:57.213048
83	/startup-idea/feeding-the-poor-from-the-supermarket	I'm sure that at some stage everyone has either seen or been asked on the street for money/donations to help the poor in the third world, normally its World Vision, UNICEF etc. I know for me one of the greatest negatives about that situation is making the commitment to sponsor a child on the spot, often it means that you have to give your credit card details to a complete stranger. What if giving to the poor and starving was as easy as buying a chocolate bar from the supermarket?\nImagine this scenario, your at your local supermarket lining up to pay for your groceries. You glance across to where the chewing gum and chocolate bars normally are and you notice a small card with a picture of a bag of flower printed on it and a price of say, $10. Your thinking to yourself "i'm about to spend $100 on food for myself, whats another $10 to feed a family in africa for a month".	2019-09-10 16:58:57.213048

87	/startup-idea/pay-for-a-dare	I saw this idea "Time machine to go back in time and invest in facebook.", and it has already 62 likes.\nI thought i could write the most stupid idea like "Eat sh-it and get rich" and i would still get a lot of likes.\n\nAnd i thought a second time about the "Eat sh-it and get rich" idea and i wondered if people would really pay others to make nasty, painful, embarrasing  and dangerous things?\nAnd i think yes, they would.\n\nSo that's my idea:\nA user sets a price for a dare, and other people pay as much as they want, until it's enough. \nOr a user offers money for a dare of his choice, and waits for someone to accept.\nEveryone has to prove his dare with a video.\n\nAnd in the end you have a lot of funny videos to get many views.	2019-09-10 16:58:58.906418

Do you find yourself arriving late for office or school because you had to wait in line for your favorite morning Starbucks coffee?\n\neQueue, a mobile app will completely remove the need to wait. While you are commuting to your favorite food chain, you can pre order food you want on your phone app based on a virtual menu. This will essentially queue you up, alerting the restaurant that you will arrive in a specified amount of time (based on your distance from the restaurant), and allow them to prepare your food ahead of time.\n\nNow all you need to do is pick up your food and pay!

95	/startup-idea/goal-setting-site-with-a-twist	A goal setting site. The idea is simple. A user deposits money on our site in escrow to motivate themselves to accomplish a goal, with a deadline. If they succeed, we pay them back. If them fail or time runs out, we donate the money to a charity of their choice.\n\nSomeone signs up and is given a form asking what their goal is, how they will measure it, when they will accomplish it by, how much money they are going to deposit and what their charity of choice is. \n\n"Accomplishing" a goal would be based on the honor system, as it is for most goal tracking websites now. The website self-selects for people who WANT to go through this process and it is impossible for a user to gain any money, so if they want to lie and reclaim their money so be it. Many people will not cheat as they would be stealing from charity plus we can make money from ads or even from taking a cut of the donation money.  Not sure yet.\n\nTo add some resistance, in order to "accomplish" a goal, users would need to at the very least answer some questions about how they did it, the time it took, how difficult it was, etc etc. Once they've done that, they get the option to reclaim their money.\n	2019-09-10 16:58:58.906418

102	/startup-idea/personal-teacher	We are at a turning point in the Education history. The online eduction is exploding, and the traditional  education system will have to update itself very soon.\n\nI'm dreaming of a personal teacher, a physical tool that you can carry with you everywhere, that will learn about you and your best learning method (everybody is not equal, some will learn better by listening, other by reading, etc), and then offer you the best learning program ever.\n\nEvery "teacher" would be connected to a cloud, and they would be able to share informations between them, which will allow us to find relevant partners for the learners, people wanting to learn the same things and living relatively close from each other.\n\nThis will require huge efforts to realize: an online platform + restful apis, a robot, etc.\nBut I believe that this would be one of the best inventions for the decades to come.	2019-09-10 16:58:59.818875

I have quite busy schedule but in the evening or sometimes on weekends I like to walk around (or outside) the city to explore it little bit more and just enjoy the walking. Problem is I don't know where to go so I just ask random people on the street. Would be great if there was a site where people post their favorite walks maybe even with pictures. Maybe it would be also interesting for couples who are looking for a small weekend trip outside their home city.	2019-09-10 16:58:59.818875

I am sure there is always a lot of people interested in it so it's kind of waste.

114	/startup-idea/universal-web-database	Problem No. 1: Imagine that you are movie fan. You know a lot about them and want to share your experience. What will you use? imdb.com etc.? Too open and overload with ads... You are lookin' for some solution but you are IT user not expert…\n\nProblem No. 2: Imagine that you are jazz music lover. Jazz is about: musicians, groups, cds, tracks, concerts, places. You want to store somewhere your experience. You need some web database which you can define, modify, fill-in through web user-friendly interfaces. What will you use? google freebase? wiki?…\n\nProblem No. 3: Imagine that you are teacher and you ask your students to collect information about solar energy: technologies, companies, products, persons, events etc. From various sources. You need perfectly categorize and classify all the stuff an present it. What tool will you use?\n\nSo the idea is something like universal web database, where even greenhorn (not IT guy) can easily create web database for real problems, easily collect data and present them. To solve all 3 above mentioned problems (and much more) with one web based tool … Nothing like this in this world driven by Google, Facebook, Apple and other big names…	2019-09-10 16:59:01.772689

Well I would like to turn that idea into an app. I am not really sure where we could make the money with it. Probably via ads once the app blows up. Basically we need an app where people can get rid of things that don't need anymore. This app would be for giveaways only. Kind of like the free section of craigslist. Is there something already like this? If there is, could we take it to the next level. I would love to work with some people on this idea.

119	/startup-idea/micro-escrow-for-the-service-industry	The Need - Small businesses need to make sure they are going to get paid once they ... Fix a car, paint a house, rewire a business so and so on. The way is is done now - either they ask for a deposit and look like a con artist or they do the work and hope the customer can pay. The Fix - Create a system where the small service business sends an escrow invoice to the customer with terms and the time / date that funds with be auto released. The customer funds escrow and when the work is done the customer is sent an email or Twilio text / email to confirm work is completed in a satisfactory  manner - then the business is paid. If if the customer does nothing the business is paid at the time discussed. If the customer is NOT happy then they deny funds (this is the only stinker of the system) this should be rare but there would need to be some legal terms / arbitration that deals with this and in most cases it would end up that the customer gets refunded and the business would need to go after them for the funds. However, this system is still loads better than the "hope for the best" system we have now.	2019-09-10 16:59:01.772689

The service would be paid for in advance and would scan your Facebook page once a day (or week) and send you an updated cost/page count.  When requested by a loved one (who has the Eulogizer password, but not your facebook password), the Euologizer downloads the file and generates the book, then sends it to the loved one.  Additional copies can be purchased by others with a link provided by the original loved on.\n\nIn an age where few people are keeping physical photo albums, this may be the only way for our children and grandchildren to really get a sense of who we were when we were alive.	2019-09-10 16:59:01.772689

This causes drivers to blow over the limit even though they have followed the guidelines.\nThe app will allow users to select what they are drinking and a timer will show when they can have another drink or their blood alcohol limit will be below the legal driving limit.	2019-09-10 16:59:01.772689

But the boat leaves port only if 5 passengers are registered. On the beach are hundreds of people, so now you can really sipmply contact them.\nExample2: Students at the university would like to share their interests. If they don`t have unique network, it is really hard to find somebody who is interested in e.g. "Java programming". So now you can find out that somebody is sitting fast beside. Good chance also for personnel clerk.\n\nBusiness plan: As you`ll finish your searching, you`ll see adds similar to your interests. E.g. for diving equipment, job offers, etc.\n\nExecution: Starting at the universities as some kind of networking, or as the open source PR of some companies.	2019-09-10 16:59:01.772689
125	/startup-idea/social-k12-education---solve-compete-succeed	We create a platform, web-based and app-based, which connects the student community using the social network. The students are initially grouped together according to their grades (K to 12). We develop the math and science problems for each grade level (content generation). The student solves those problems and earn points. The more points they earn the higher they climb on their 'problem solving score'. When they cross a certain threshold they move to the next level. The students can post problems too. They earn extra credit when their problems are accepted, which other students solve for. We build a problem solving competition among the student community socially and across the globe. To top it off, we organize a one-off competition once a year across grade levels to earn prizes and assign the 'star' of the year award to the student. We promote healthy competition, the urge to solve problems and help them succeed in their life.	2019-09-10 16:59:01.772689
126	/startup-idea/collective-shopping	Problem: usually buying  a product in one or few units is more expensive than buying at bulk. It happens also that many websites offers you free delivery if you buy more than a certain total value. This is sometimes too much for a single buyer.\n\nSolution: develop a website or an app that could identify users in a certain region (e.g. living within 5 km), that are interested to buy a certain product or from a same supplier / store. If they buy altogether, they can reach significant savings on orders and delivery by the store or pick-up at store.	2019-09-10 16:59:01.772689

Too often are they bogged down in one place for weeks or months working to generate enough cash to move on to another place. That's not traveling, that's temporary living. My idea is that a traveler will never have to stop, always on the move.\n\nI want to enable short term employment for as little as one day/night for unskilled jobs like waiting tables, bar work, laboring, keeping the traveler moving as much as possible. \n\nMy vision is that you could pull up an app with a map that has live job listing pin in specific locations or at least places known for hiring travelers short term. This eliminates the need to walk into every bar and knock on every door trying to find work. \n\nThis could potentially turn into an advice centre for all things traveling. Recommended sights, transport, hostels and traveler friendly areas to meet other like minded people.\n\nI only speak English and have no experience of mobile app development, so anyone that has something to offer and would like to get on board, I would be happy to hear from you.	2019-09-10 16:59:03.568645

I was thinking of a website which a student would log in and search up internship opportunities present in their city.

Have you ever feel like you're just always on-the-go and trapped in the present, never able to remember and cherish moments from the past? Have you ever asked yourself "what am I doing?", and "where am I supposed to go from here?"?\n\nHere is an app that could help you remember who you were and who you are, by collecting and cherishing personal & private moments.

141	/startup-idea/global-search-engine-for-group-discounts	There is hundreds of sites like Groupon all over the web in many countries. They are usually copy-cats but still you can find interesting offers there. I could really use a search engine that would allow me to search in all of them at once no matter where I am at the moment. Even if I am traveling to Paris I do not need to find group discount sites in France but go to this one I am already using back home.	2019-09-10 16:59:03.568645
142	/startup-idea/grocery-planner	People spend hundreds of dollars on groceries every month, but don’t have a great understanding of how much they’re actually consuming and in what quantities.

143	/startup-idea/sounds-from-places	When I look at a map at home, I want to hear some sounds which represent the place, and then look around to listen to. On the other hand, when I go to places like huge mall or public spaces, I want to hear some personalized selective sounds or announcement lead me to preferable spot. D-land has very simplified one. If geo tagged personal voice assistant like Siri is available, audio guide will be available anywhere other than museum.

144	/startup-idea/hello---app-get-social-again-with-minimum-effort	Hello is an app, which spontaneously lets you share questions like: „Hello! Who wants to go for a drink?“ or „Hello! Who wants to join a pick nick?“ The trick is, that its more spontaneous than normal social networks like Facebook. Furthermore the „Hello“ can be sent out in a distance around you which you choose and be public, private, or may aim at certain people (youngsters, Nirvana fans, entrepreneurs). It seems simple, but would work because people don’t want to be chained to decisions too long in advance any more, plus its a great way of contacting people in physical reality in a time when the gets harder because everybody is just looking at the computer.	2019-09-10 16:59:04.505009

What if there was a way to connect these travelers with people who need to get a packages delivered to the destinations to which they are traveling? Platform would be free to join for both travelers and people needing to have packages shipped. Shipper would post their needs and travelers would bid. Huge potential for this platform.

Commit to a new diet? commit to a month being vegan..? etc etc \n\nWe have all made in our life many resolutions, promises and good purposes and what typically happens is that we immediately share them with friends and family looking for additional motivation and support. Support of those we love and other people is fundamental for managing to maintain a promise with ourself.\n\nI often think and imagine a website that allows users to upload a "resolution" challenge (say, quit smoking) in a similar way like one would upload a campaign on Kickstarter. The user than is incentivised to share his plan (with all the details, benefits and timeframe) within his community (social media) who are assumed will want to show their support through various rewards and digital interactions.	2019-09-10 16:59:04.505009

What about having a phone number where you call and they arrange it for you. The tough part would be to keep the costs low.

152	/startup-idea/software-factory	Industry-wide research from a reputable research firm revealed that over 65% of software projects are ether over-budget, over-time or never completed.\n\nTo the rescue comes Software Factory - a future of software development. It's a marketplace that provides to Business people 100% guaranty of project completion: on-time, on-budget and to the specifications and does that cheaper and faster due to crowd-sourced library of pre-coded reusable software blocks and few additional technologies.\n\nThis removes business risk of software development failure.\n\nBenefit to developers: They get to produce high quality code in projects that get finished. They get paid each time their code is reused in hundreds or even thousands of projects. (Like a writer for each copy of his book) They can work faster because large part of thinking of how to implement something already had been done.	2019-09-10 16:59:04.505009
153	/startup-idea/reminder-app-for-taking-medicine-in-time	Peoples take a lot of medicines. Few medicine are before meal, some are after meals. Few have to take in morning, other have to take in night. Sometimes we forget to take medicine in time. It happens more when we travels a lot or when prescriptions change or any other reasons. Sometimes we forget to purchase new medicine when it near to finish. Due to that we face trouble in taking medicine regularly and continuously. \nIf we develop a simple mobile app and upload our current medicine data with applicable time table to take in that will reminding us every day during morning, day, evening or night. If we put the quantity of medicine each time after purchase, then it may remind when it is going to finish. \nWe may install it in our mobile/laptop it sounds every time to remind us.	2019-09-10 16:59:04.505009
154	/startup-idea/customized-greeting-cards-delivered	About a decade ago, people used to go to a store and handpick a card, write their message and send. Now people just go online, choose a flash animation and send it. No real emotions are put into it. Its just a formality now. So my idea is to make a web app which lets you handpick cards from a virtual store (a complete card shop interface) and then lets you customize it, (write stuff anywhere, draw on it, put pictures maybe) and then We deliver it 'by post' to your loved one. Payments will be online of course at the time of sending. To reduce the price of sending a card, I plan to collaborate with some advertisement agencies, so along with your card, you get a small sheet with some ads. In return, these agencies give money which will help in posting the cards.	2019-09-10 16:59:04.505009

So the couples (or one of them) would set the budget they're willing to spend for each vendor and vendors can accept the work for the budget they specified.\n\nYou would ask, what's in it for the vendors? The vendors are intended for amateurs to get more portfolio or to get the words of mouth out. So it's really benefiting both parties in a sense.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n	2019-09-10 16:59:06.264693

This app effectively combines business, entertainment, social media and telecommunication which are the main reasons why people use the internet for nowadays. Therefore it has a great potential of over taking the whole internet. This app will aid entertainers to make money online easily and there presence will attract more users since fans want to stay connected with there favorite entertainers. Many people spend hours on social media so this app will also encourage users with an entrepreneurial mind to make money easily using this app while they socialize with friends and family.

I believe a lot of people would love to have more flexibility and freedom in their work, and that this is possible with today's crowdsourcing tools. Whether you are starting a startup or project and need skilled worked to be done, or whether you are tired of your 9-5 or just want to make some money in your spare time doing some skilled work or providing expertise, there should be a way to match needs with skills: viola, a skills marketplace where people can share their needs and others can fill them. \n\nWhen starting a business or a tech startup, some of the biggest challenges are finding funding and cheap, skilled team members or labor in an efficient way to get the project off the ground. Ideally, people could also receive funding for their ideas and find team members for their projects on the marketplace, as well as receive feedback regarding their projects in order to refine their idea.

For example I want to travel from London to Birmingham and doesn't matter with what type of vehicle and providing company. It's pretty difficult to search such things when you are foreigner and don't know anything about local transportation companies.

193	/startup-idea/sell-startup-ideas	I've read on many websites, that the most of the startup ideas will never born, because of many reasons: people are hesitating, they dont have money, they convince themselves that its not a good idea, or people around them convince them to not to start the business. And this is absolutely true, I had sooooooo many ideas in the past year, and I'm sure there was some very good amongst them, but I did  not have the money to start it. \nI'm sure everybody was in the same situation.\nSo my idea: to make a website, where people can upload their startup ideas, and sell them. I dont mean just the idea, the uploader will do the rest of the job, everything that can be done without or with less money: write a businness plan, plan everything, even make a logo or a website for example, etc. \nAnd then, people who has the money or the opportunity to make a startup, can buy these almost ready startups, and make them born to life.\nThis way, people who dont want or cant make a startup, can make money about their ideas, and startuppers can get almost- ready ideas, and they can spare a lots of work.	2019-09-10 16:59:08.860609

196	/startup-idea/automated-accounts-receivable-management-software	Accounts receivables is a nightmare for businesses of any size.  companies live and die by their aging reports -- i.e. who owes what and how far out the debt is (past 30 days, 60, 90, etc.)  Each week, someone from the company has to contact all vendors and check in on the status of payment with their vendor's A/P department.  This is time consuming and a real pain. How about a simple SaaS platform that allows businesses to upload their aging reports (with phone and email info for each account) and have an auto-dialer deliver pre-recorded calls to their past due customers -- i.e. "Hi, this is Judy from X company.  We are checking on the status of invoice 1122 for $3000.  Please send payment promptly, or press 1 now to discuss this balance. Thank you.

There is a site when everybody can set a price for his rumour and give some hints what is about.

My idea is to have a e-commerce website where in a user selects items and asks vendors to quote.  Once the user approves  a quote , the  details would flow to vendor's portal as requirements and my portal would earn commission from vendor.  It would work like a peer to peer or broadcast tender.  This would help local grocery store to become competitive  if the user's location is near to his shop.

However the reality is also this that , many seats remain vacant especially during off peak seasons and week days. My idea is  to create a space where in  user selects his preferred mode of travel , give probable start date of travel (+/- tolerance) , source and target destination , gender and age . He would also state , till which time before start date he would like to take confirmed offer from transporter (say Till 3 Hrs before 22 Hrs on 25/09/2014) . He will  also state minimum and maximum he would offer for the journey .  He will deposit the maximum agreed amount  in the web . There will be filters for the user like preferred transporter , preferred timing etc . Transporters will view  such requirement and quote. User will confirm one and money will flow to the transporter once transporter confirms the booking.. This will help both the transporter and the traveler.	2019-09-10 16:59:09.852948

207	/startup-idea/machine-learning-in-sports-forecasting	People are looking for different methods of investment, from currency exchanges to buying companies’ shares and trading futures. All these methods share one major flaw – already heavily applied Machine Learning and prediction models damaged these markets so severely, that it is almost impossible for the small and middle-size investor (who have a couple of thousands of dollars) to make a profit.\n\nSports forecasting is different – results of sporting events cannot be skewed by any number of subjects (bettors) operating on the market. The match will end exactly the same no matter how many people bets on which team.\n\nAnd the results can be predicted with extreme accuracy: I already have Machine Learning model which is able to predict Soccer results with over 80% accuracy, and it indeed makes a profit (for leagues I have data about). The same modelling technique can be applied to any sport… All is needed is constant flow of statistical sports data… Already achieved 80% accuracy on sports market actually gives higher profit than any above-mentioned investment method.	2019-09-10 16:59:09.852948

213	/startup-idea/a-better-version-of-this-website	I found this website while doing market research for my own idea and seeing what competition was out there for open source idea generation.  I think the general idea of this site is great but it's implementation is flawed in a few key areas.  I propose creating a similar site that improves upon this idea by: \n- Better organizing areas of interest.  Rather than providing a search field (if we knew what we were looking for why would be here) emphasizing areas of interest and funneling like minded individuals towards areas of collaboration.  \n- Allowing ideas to evolve organically: Rather than simply having an area for comments on static ideas, allow ideas to branch out from a more general category and teams to organically form as a result.\n- Creating relationships with startup incubators to develop the top ideas: herein lies the business model: the site could in itself be an incubator of sorts.  "Our team" could both contribute to ideas and become active in ideas that interest us. \n- The key idea is going from the general to the specific.  Relating to each user at a higher level and let their interests and skill sets branch to form teams.	2019-09-10 16:59:11.135561

But I bet if you were on any social network you enjoyed watching them. Especially those videos of people you knew.I present to you Etched. The idea of Etched is to bring friends together in the real world. Nowadays technology has stopped people communicating face to face and with Etched we can change that.So what do you do with Etched?<br>Well with Etched you can set challenges for you and friends to complete within a time frame. For example, you create a group and set a challenge for your friends Bob and Alice. Bob and Alice then both review the challenge and can either Accept or Decline the challenge. If they accept challenge:<br>They are in the "group". They must also take a video that can be no longer than a minute(Might change that time). They can either post the video as private(Only the group members can see it) or public (Anyone can see it). <br>Some other possible options I could include are to add a feature where you can only see videos from within a 10 or so mile radius.

225	/startup-idea/easily-import-bank-balances-into-finance-software	Easily import bank balances into finance software\n\nYou need to reconcile your bank and credit card balances with your personal finance software like MoneyWell, iBank, or Mint. But your bank doesn't support Direct Connect, OFX (Open Financial Exchange), or even doesn't provides QIF (Quicken Interchange Format) for your transaction history. Thus you need to massage their CSV output (which are often not in the format that your software expects) or worse, key in your transactions one-by one. What adds pain to the wound is that you need to do this every month when you reconcile your accounts.\n\nWOuldn't it be great if there is an application that helps you import your banks' statements through their e-banking websites into the formats that your software expects? Even when your bank's aren't even aware what OFX or Direct Connect means?	2019-09-10 16:59:11.135561
226	/startup-idea/social-network-for-pet-adopters	Sometimes we have too many pets. Either we adopt more stray cats/dogs, or maybe our cats give birth and the kittens start to become too much for us to handle, we want to share our pets to others, let other care for them. But we don't know who might be interested in adopting, and where to look\n\nWe can make a social network just for this purpose. So that we can be sure that the pets are in good hands. In this social network, users can search for the kind of animals they want (cats, dogs, fish, lizards, etc.) or search for people that are interested in spesific kinds of pets.	2019-09-10 16:59:12.056715
227	/startup-idea/faster-shopping-on-internet	I would like to create a web application that would speed up shopping on the internet e.g. on ebay.com. \nIn the application you uploaded an image of what you want\nand after that chosen according to similarity search. \nApplications should show a percentage according to the similarity. Then you could choose from categories such as cheapest seler or authorized seler. Applications should be based on the principle of comparing persons in the police but for commercial use. Furthermore, it could also compare the video when I see something in a movie and I want it now it can search and buy it. What do you want to get now.	2019-09-10 16:59:12.056715
228	/startup-idea/travel-card	So, you are traveling around some farm in India and you meet a bunch of beautiful ladies from Hungary. You talk and realize that they are Heading to Singapore next and you will be doing so too. You want to exchange contacts with person. What are your current methods of doing so?\n\n1. Pen and Paper\n2. notepad on smartphone\n3. ??\n\nWhy not this: Create an app (TravelCard). In this app, you sign up, and input all your details that you would like to share. Then, if you want to share it with someone who has the app, you just need to add the person's unique ID. You can also add this person offline and when you have connection, your phone will automatically retrieve the data and all the information will be synced with your phone. \n\nIf the person does not have this app (was he living under a rock?), you can also select an option to send your card to him via whatsapp/email/whatever when you have wifi access again.	2019-09-10 16:59:12.056715

230	/startup-idea/a-rent-management-website	Property renting is mostly done by agents / ad hoc - as a result it is very difficult to track the performance of tenants and landlords.\n\nMy idea is to offer a website that will “manage” property renting. Hence the system will build the tenants’ profile as they pay on time or not, landlords build their profile as they respond to tenant requests, and both tenants and landlords can recommend each other. \n\nAs a result, both tenants and landlords can make a better informed decision on which property to rent and to whom.\n	2019-09-10 16:59:12.056715
231	/startup-idea/putting-wikitravel-on-the-gmap	Problem: Wikitravel is a great source of free and open travel information. It is very useful for detailed information, but too detailed for just getting inspired or broad planning. If we could only tap into this great source for this purpose...\n\nSolution: a mashup displaying Wikitravel articles on Google Maps. The articles should be displayed at their relevant area, respecting scale, which means "Asia" would be an area, "Malaysia" a level down, and "Melacca" another level down etc. This would allow browsing the map by area and levels of detail. The information shown should only display pictures, what to do, key features etc (so excluding hotels, getting in and other detailed planning information) keeping it focused on deciding where to go.	2019-09-10 16:59:12.056715
232	/startup-idea/click-for-charity	People now a days may not have the time or money for charity. So why not create an online platform where charity organizations can post their events and we provide a list sponsors(signed up with us) to them to help raise funds. For each click from the public to "like (FB)", "tweet", do survey", etc according to what the sponsors want, the attached charity event get money (according to the number of clicks) donated to them from the sponsors. This way the charity not only raise money but also increase awareness, while sponsors get to fulfill their objectives ( increasing 'likes', 'tweets',etc) and is an alternative way of advertising $$. For the public, they only need to spend a small fraction of their time to support these charity without spending a single cent. They also can help publicize these events to their family and friends. \nFor every click, we take a cut from the money given by the sponsors	2019-09-10 16:59:12.056715

235	/startup-idea/connect-buyers-and-sellers-of-sponsorship	Businesses are constantly flooded with sponsorship proposals from brands/events which aren't aligned with their company vision, and they hardly waste time reading these lengthy proposals.\n\nLet's build a web-based platform for all sponsorship needs. Users seeking sponsorship can list their proposal online(only the most important information is required) and sponsors can easily find the ones which suit them.

240	/startup-idea/easier-way-to-find-people-with-the-same-interests	The idea i have makes it easy to find people with the same interests. \n\nTo find similiar people, every user has to submit the things he likes (hobby, music, movies), dislikes, age, gender and location.\n\nSo if someone with a rare hobby is looking for people who likes it too, \nhe just writes a proposal to meet with them and enters some tags like "Location", "Hobby" and "how many people" to find the right persons.\nThe proposal goes around until the chosen number of people have accepted the offer.\n\nBut you could even reach millions of people with a proposal. But if everyone wants to do that,\nthen there would be just too much proposals. So you need some critical users who judge these ideas/proposals.\nSo the more people you want to reach, the more rounds of judging your proposal has to pass.\n\nSo if you want to reach 10 people your proposal doesn't need to pass.\nBut if you are looking for more than 10 people, your proposal has to be judged.\n\nFor what could we use this:\n- Meet other people with the same interests\n- Help someone\n- To point to close events\n- Funny actions\n- Push new videos\n- Demonstrations\n- Push interesting websites\n- Show informations about favorite musicians\n- Petitions\n\n\n\n	2019-09-10 16:59:13.043633

242	/startup-idea/favors	Some kind of favors system where you can request any kind of favor from both your friends and the public. There could be interesting "pay it forward" features and other rewarding systems. The idea is that if someone needs help, this is the place to get it and receive it. Ask for a favor today! \n\nYou can decide what kind of favor you need:\n- funding\n- rate a content (picture, article, video, etc) with different modes available (commenting, star rating, thumbs)\n- support (gather awareness)\n- contest voting\n- real life situations (gatherings, help doing something)\n- click on a link, follow a social profile\n- etc. etc.\n\nEach kind of favor has it's specific format. Accomplished favors should be able to be verified in order to give credit to the person who helped out - hey, s/he should be probably be rewarded, right? Whether it's with a shiny trophy, a thank you or credits....\n\nThis isn't a marketplace like the amazing fivver.com - where you offer services or pay for something - it's a favorplace. People are motivated by helping others out.\n\nSo, do me a favor, let me know what you think.	2019-09-10 16:59:13.043633
243	/startup-idea/resource-planning-tool-for-education-providers	Problems faced by Teachers at School: \n1.) Too much curriculum, too little time\n2.) Absence of Customized planning tools for education providers. \n\nSolution: \n1.) Take additional tasks such as time-table development, performance monitoring and attendance monitoring off the teacher and assign it to software suite operated by a trained individual. This reduces the time a teacher takes to calculate monthly attendance for a class from 3 hrs. to less than 5 mins. As the attendance will be uploaded daily on to the system, which provides a real time day wise update in form of a pie chart as well as bar graph, comparing individual attendance with that of the class while highlighting leaves with permission, sick leaves and un-consented leaves, this will also provide real time update on internal tests along with parents of the student through a mobile app and web-based portal. Thus connecting parents, students and teachers and enabling overall development of the student. \n\n2.) Developing a self explanatory module for teachers revolving around basic uses of internet with relevance to their respective subjects. \n\n3.) At present there is no dedicated, RP tools only for education providers.	2019-09-10 16:59:13.043633

250	/startup-idea/customer-initiated-deal-website	I would like to see a site developed which allows users (us) to input the details of a business which they would like to offer them a deal. So your favorite local Pizza restaurant could be asked to sell vouchers for pizzas at 50% off. Once enough people register, the business is asked to participate in the deal. This way the deal comes from the users, not the business, and small local businesses can get in on the 'deal' act. Imagine a small restaurant getting 100 people saying they would pay $30 for a $50 meal. To participate in a deal could cost $1 to the user and nothing to the business.

Now, You imagine an app that let you agree on a fine to be paid for every minute a person is late to a meeting.\nThe app will be used to agree on a meeting time and also on the fine per every minute a person is late. The app is connected to the mobile subscriber account or mobile wallet, and the fine is  automatically charged to his account, maximum $15 per meeting.\nThe money is either transferred to the person who arrived on time at the meeting or to a charity. If all the people who have agreed on the meeting are late, all participants are fined and the money could be donated to a charity.\nMobile developers interested to explore this app idea will need to think a bit more about the edges, but this is a Killer app for the African market where people are chronically late.\n	2019-09-10 16:59:13.043633

269	/startup-idea/couchsurfing-mobile-app	For those who know/use couchsurfing. Otherwise http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchSurfing %0aIf you dont do your "research" before your travel, you will have to do it on the way. More probable is using a mobile phone, because not everybody takes his/her laptop with (many reasons). But navigating their website on iphone/android phone is horrific. This mobile app could be extremely useful, just because couchsurfing is about being mobile. While traveling, it can save your day when you need it.	2019-09-10 16:59:16.653547
270	/startup-idea/international-virtual-mobile-phone-operator	We all know this from traveling. When you arrive to a different country or you buy a local SIM-card (but nobody knows your number) or use your home SIM-card (but pay tremendously high prices for roaming calls). Why not to have world-wide mobile phone operator working anywhere in the planet with more reasonable call rates. It would be a virtual phone operator (many contracts with local operators) tranfering international calls via VOIP in order to obtain better rates.	2019-09-10 16:59:16.653547
271	/startup-idea/taxi-dispatching-system	I design a business plan - detail like that, the current taxi dispatching system is transferring to GPS, but still each taxi company has its own system, some of them have been using iPhone APPs, or Android APPs (Passengers can save money, don't waste mobile phone call). Whatever APPs, still, passengers can only use that APPs to call that taxi company. If you want to know each taxi company taxi dispatching, then u have to install all APPs. I design the flow and platform to be C2C, the system will have Driver APP, and Passenger APP. The Taxi Driver (whatever taxi company) simply install that Jordan's drver app, then can get the passenger app call. With this system, taxi driver can save more money from taxi company. At the same time, passenger can choose the proper taxi ( search reach result, can see car brand, how old, recommendation, how long distance, ... ) Anyone want to invest this system. Or not worth?	2019-09-10 16:59:16.653547
272	/startup-idea/terms-and-conditions-builder	When launching a website I never know what to write into Terms and conditions. Can anyone build a builder for that? It should ask me a few questions about the site (name, domain, company, whether it uses Facebook login etc.) and generate the text. I would definitely pay for it a reasonable amount below the lawyer rate!	2019-09-10 16:59:16.653547
285	/startup-idea/college-listing	As a college student, I frequently find myself broke and browsing through Craigslist for odd jobs or trying to sell miscellaneous items for a quick buck. Craigslst is unfortunately filled with a whole lot of spam and a whole lot of searching. College Listing would be a monitored and moderated app/website with no spam and no BS. With College Listings you could find jobs and ads posted specifically by college students in your area, as it would require a profile and a .edu email. The profile would also allow for some sort of rating system to ensure that you aren't walking into the last deal of your life with the next up and coming Craigslist killer. I have no idea how to go about putting this plan into actio but it needs to happen, so someone please help me get this idea rolling!	2019-09-10 16:59:18.412389
273	/startup-idea/experimental-helping-bot	I am constantly improving, experimenting and creating something. Once I manage to create a bot which helps me with different tasks (like learning foreign languages):\nhttp://pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=31509\nMaybe it doesn't look stunning (because actually to work it needs only two fields though: input and output - anything else is not essential), but it is working already very good and it's still getting better with the time. I made it in PHP, because I thought to commercialize it, but now it's going rather from commercial to more complex experimental state (because there is still far more to get out from it). I will work also to transfer it from PHP to Python programming language to merge my other ideas with it.\n\nCan someone help me to find the way to get some financing that I could work 24/7 on this (and other) ideas, plz? Unfortunately I can't use kickstarter, because I am not living in the US.	2019-09-10 16:59:16.653547

277	/startup-idea/renting-furniture-for-temporary-students	We all know students are not the richest people on the world. I often see that students are searching for an (temporary) apartment for about 1-4 years. <br><br>So why not creating an online platform for students so that they can rent furniture for a low price each month/year? Something like a subscription model. For example: if they want to rent the furniture for 4 years, they can keep the furniture (as a gift). Or if they want to rent more furniture, they can get monthly discount. This has a lot of benefits for students, because they can save a lot of money! <br><br>I really want to realise something like that, so hopefully there are enough people that want to support me! Tips are welcome!	2019-09-10 16:59:16.653547
278	/startup-idea/packing-checker-via-augmented-reality	When you leave for holidays I bet you also have that feeling you forgot something. I want to have a mobile application where you create a list of things you should take with you and then when you have all the stuff at your bed ready to put it into the bag you just take one picture of all of them and the app compare it with the list. I suppose you might need to take picture of each item individually so it can easily compare it. In that case the market could be rather in people who travel often and bring similar stuff all the time.	2019-09-10 16:59:16.653547

There you will have a blind date so you can also enjoy the right food acording to both profiles and you receive tips to go well into the meeting also you dont need to worry because both will agree to pay your own food and also if you like the meeting you can invite the person again and get connected with by using the social tools on the website, give feedback and inspire others to try the same.	2019-09-10 16:59:16.653547
280	/startup-idea/game-as-means-of-acquisition-of-foreign-language	Online game as means of acquisition of foreign language(s) like one's mother tongue: The concept is an Internet portal that recreates the natural atmosphere of speech. The portal involves users through the creation of an immersive gaming environment. Each visitor starts his/her “virtual life” from childhood. As in real life, progression through the game involves seeing, hearing and interacting with the environment. The environment is fully represented by the target foreign language giving users the possibility to learn and progress in a natural manner." It would look like the first person simulator. I’d like to call your attention to that it is not a networking game and therefore does not presuppose communication or interaction between “gamers.” It does mean that no gamer speaking bad foreign language or not speaking foreign language at all will “teach” the other gamer. The online game will be based on screenplay written in advance where each stage of baby development will have a certain words, word combinations, sentences, situations and so on which, as in real life, occur on one or another baby development stage. \r\n	2019-09-10 16:59:16.653547
281	/startup-idea/need-money-work-fun-idea-contribution-system	My idea is to CREATE something together at least!\n\nI'm very short period here, but I see that people are not doing anything even with their own ideas. It's difficult to see any discussion here. Pressing 'like' button is not enough though to see something alive!\nIt looks like people need a custom motivation/contribution system to do something (I could create such a system!)\nSo how about some monthly 5EUR subscription system of 100's of people (us!) which will contribute to some top ideas until they stand on their own financial feet (and contribute later to other projets as well). \nIt's all about us to do something.\nSo:\n1st - Let's communicate! Contact me at least (through discussion panel here, twitter or www.wspornik.pl)\n2nd - Let's start shaping any idea from IW site!\n3rd - You don't want talking and don't want doing anything? -> donate someone, plz!\n4th - Scared to risk 5EUR? -> Just spread the word about good ideas or people who need some financial support!\n5th - Don't want to do anything? -> Prepare to regret, that you've never joined the team of most creative people and that you will not be between first ones to get some never seen before results of never seen before projects.	2019-09-10 16:59:16.653547

It could be an adventure game, collecting items or talking to people, or perhaps signing-in to a wifi on certain spots, talking to a person in a certain bar etc. It would be much more interesting than just walking around with a camera :)	2019-09-10 16:59:18.412389
293	/startup-idea/verified-anonymous-online-identity-provider	When using online sites, you may want someone to believe that you are a real person (and not a scammer, spammer or otherwise not as described) . Also \n\nSo the idea is to create a Open ID provider which can be used as an authentication system by websites which, rather than just returning your identity to the authenticating site, will instead return an anonymised identity, with a generated email address (e.g. user1231231@anonymousidprovider.com), thus protecting the user.\n\nFurther to this, the provider would allow the user to verify facts about themselves by connecting to facebook, providing credit card details. This can be then used to produce a trustworthiness factor which sites using the provider can access (still anonymously though).\n\nThis would help cut down online fraud, spamming and have uses for sites like airbnb and ebay etc.	2019-09-10 16:59:18.412389

319	/startup-idea/social-network-for-2-way-learning-of-language	It is clear that the most effective way to learn new language is by active practicing. So why not to develop a website where people can meet each other and start so called 2 way learning. For example 1st person speaks German, 2nd person speaks English.

It also connects people and has social effect.	2019-09-10 16:59:21.874571
320	/startup-idea/universal-food-menu	How about a mobile app which'd enable people to share what they're eating, where, price etc. This could then be used to recommend based on your preferences, what your friends are having, price and what not.

How many of us have felt bad about not being able to attend someone's funeral just cos' of your geographic separation or some inevitable reason? The funeral will never shift its date to adjust your schedule (of course) but there could be a social networking site where we could mourn about our loved and departed ones. If facebook would be your solution, then how would you "like" someone's update with the contents: "my friend expired last nite". You could comment RIP but that does not fulfill the duty of MOURNING.

323	/startup-idea/bot-helper	Every day we use the internet for getting information. Often it happens that the day-to-day we are looking for the same type of information, for example we check new email, check weather in our city and etc...I want to create bot which will do for me many useful things. Description of bot: A bot is a server application that will start and send to the user information. We can use many transports: email, http, irc, xmpp, skype, different enterprise messengers like campfire or something else. All software consists from 2 parts: bot and plugins. Bot - is server application which will execute plugins. Every plugin is simple task which bot can execute. \nThe bot will have two modes: Notification - user choose plugins and setup the time intervals over which they perform. For example: twitter plugin - bot will send to chat room last 5 tweet from some twitter account every 20 minutes (only example).Request - user send to bot some request and got response. \nFor example: Hey bot calc me 1 + \n1. Bot sends response \n2. I try to find someone to help me to find the way to get some financing that I could work 24/7 on this project? I can't use kickstarter, because I am not living in the US.	2019-09-10 16:59:21.874571

338	/startup-idea/digital-marketing-agency	Digital marketing is the overall approach of attracting and engaging potential customers via online channels and devices. These methods include website creation, search engine optimization, pay per click advertising, email marketing, social media, display advertising and other channels to drive traffic and conversions.\nThus, a digital marketing agency performs some or all of the digital marketing functions of a separate company, typically multiple other companies. The business relationship is typically either project based, or retainer based, and may or may not include traditional marketing, creative and branding as well. \nIf you have experience in digital marketing, there are many advantages that make a digital marketing agency attractive. You don't have to be experienced in every aspect of the creative work since you can hire others to work for you. Start-up costs are low since you need only equipment and a small space to get started.	2019-09-10 16:59:24.05672

(maybe have some sort handwriting verification software to identify the hand writing) and it will give you the location and the option to get directions. It quick and easy. \nAlso, you can have the option of having the app get access to your contacts and be able to press the step/direction you are currently at (or maybe have a simple button) and it will send an auto text to who ever you are trying to meet that you are close by (they can preset who they are meeting before along with if they want them to know the exact location or how far away they are in time or miles --- or maybe even a step further having an advance option where they can put a custom text and attach it to a certain location - that way when that person reaches that part/location/direction of the journey  it will just send that text to them without even pressing anything at all.	2019-09-10 16:59:24.05672
341	/startup-idea/motion-gesture-based-apps-control	The latest apps that I've seen for gesture control apps is based on that we write a gesture on mobile screen , like W and it opens up whatsapp . Similarly for other things.\nI propose to create an app that is based on motion gesture ( based on Accelerometer data ). Like I make a W in the air and Whatsapp opens, I make a gesture M and Messages opens. Each user trains its own set of gestures for different apps. and we don't need to open an app to make gestures. The app keeps running in background and looks for action only when a gesture is made.\nMoreover, Gesture based Authentication can be implemented. Like we do a signature in the air with our smartphone and the phone gets unlocked.\nI have done all this with Accelerometer data in MATLAB and writing research paper on it but now i plan to turn it into an app. I'm seeking investment and an android and iOS developer for the idea.	2019-09-10 16:59:24.05672

357	/startup-idea/i-need-it-here-app	The idea of this app is that mobile users use their current location and they specify what business is needed in that location,for example a store or a hotel that is specialised for a community, a bakery ,a clinic, or anything.Suppose some one puts up an idea like that other users in the area vote up the idea.So  say i need an indian restaurant in my area and i get around 500 votes,that shows the feaibility of opening a restaurant in that area.This data is shown to potential businessmen who are looking to open an indian restaurant and then they can choose a location for that.Similarly if a public utility is missing in an area,the amount of votes for that idea can be shown to the authorities for installing that utility in that area.This app can gather requirements(demand) for a location from multiple users and then show it to people who can fulfill that ideas(suppliers) thus helping business	2019-09-10 16:59:25.837819

361	/startup-idea/online-overview-of-skills-really-used-in-jobs-	It is quite difficult to imagine when you are at elementary school or high school what exactly does it take to be a doctor or a lawyer or a business analyst. Usually it's heavily stereotyped. What I miss is a site where people who are actually working share what kind of skills they really use on the daily basis in their jobs. It could help if real doctors tell you how much is the work about paperwork or IT so you should prepare yourself. What needs to be figured out is the motivational system. I think parents could pay a test for their children that would suggest them several jobs based on what they like to do and what they can cope with and the already working people can get a small reward for a few minutes of their time that would help children to choose a job they actually like to do.	2019-09-10 16:59:25.837819

366	/startup-idea/personal-shopper-for-electronics	The idea is that busy professionals would rather spend their time billing at high hourly rates or with family and friends instead of shopping online. Most "personal shoppers" target those looking for high end clothing. This service would be about finding deals on items like TV's, computers, gaming consoles, sound systems, etc... There are many automated systems that compare prices online, like pricegrabber, google's own service. These services are fine but pale in comparison to the personalized service a human could provide. A personal shopper could read reviews, compare products based on different criteria, find items on Ebay, etc... The price per search would be relatively low.	2019-09-10 16:59:26.401919

The platform will coordinate the workflow between the journalists, editors and proof-readers and will allow them to publish the content with just one click according to the rules, created in the platform.\n\nMy experience in big online media shows that journalists and editors spend too much time transferring the content of their articles from text documents to the CMS of their companies, making many errors during that process.\n\nThe platform can be also developed for another open-source project as Drupal, which has similar problems.	2019-09-10 16:59:26.401919

Users can sign up by adding their fingerprint to the database through a mobile app. Businesses that have a BioPass fingerprint reader allow shoppers to pay with a simple finger tap on the reader. The amount is then charged to the credit card assigned by the user through the app.\n\nThe system can also be implemented into public transportation.

This way both the purpose is served. Party A continues to remain fit. Party B continues to get basic nutrition. \n\nThe unhealthy calories which party A( donors) could have eaten but instead did not eat, gets converted into a monetary value.

My solution will allow products to be bought overseas at almost the same price sold in country of origin with a minimal service fee, very efficient shipping of items and a platform for anyone overseas to employ this platform to start their business.  <br>I am currently based in Singapore and looking for partners overseas who are interested and motivated to know more about the idea so that we can work together to form a global network of shoppers.	2019-09-10 16:59:26.401919

399	/startup-idea/augmented-social-media	The current layout for social media consist of pictures, videos, news stories, and so on in list form where users scroll up and down to see content. This idea completely changes the way we consume content by using the world around us as a blueprint. The same technology that brought us Pokemon Go would be used for this app. The app would allow users to drop media in the real world where other users could see it with their cameras. Imagine turning on the app and scanning the world around you where off in the distance you see an augmented note on the ground. You walk up to it and tap the note which allows you to read it right where the person dropped it. Users could drop pictures, videos, notes, anything you can think of. Another example is augmented graffiti where users can draw on a wall via the app for other users to see. Ultimately the goal of this app would be to combine with augmented glasses (i.e. hololens) which would provide users with the best experience.	2019-09-10 16:59:28.491951

I've long thought, and tweeted that "Spotify for Soccer" is a great idea, and honestly I'm surprised it's taking so long for someone to get on it. I think it's likely related to the fact that it's only a small % of, for example, SV, that would appreciate the challenge (as they likely don't watch/play soccer) and the scale of the opportunity (it's not very well known that soccer is way bigger than any other sport)\n\nBut the opportunity, to me, is this: The biggest sport in the world can't easily be watched online, so the vast majority are turning to piracy and dodgy sites to watch instead. The parallels with music pre-iTunes are pretty staggering.	2019-09-10 16:59:28.491951

So here is the app to find just the right doctors for every medical field which is recommended by people only after a verification process through minimum of lets say 10 successful stories with a ranking system as well. It would highlight failed stories with details as to why . Another feature would be linking to maps for doctor exact location to make it completely accessible. Doctor information upload could only happen based on successful authentication of user with their experience and details.\nExample - A family shifts to new place or in remote place  during some transit have no knowledge of reliable/good doctors around. Usually they phone relatives and figure out and still may not be sure but have to rely on.

Start with guest 1 and their order, as the app allows you to select from the menu and add notes as required. \n\nOrders are delivered to a delivery system to the cooks. \n\nThe server can set a timer meant to return to the table in 5,10,15 increments. \n\nThe app can separate orders in the check out process, asking the server to highlight what couples/groups are together and whether its cash or credit. \n\nWe can use the Square to process cards.	2019-09-10 16:59:28.491951

Let's say you can type in what you have left in your fridge, 3 eggs, 100ml of milk, half a broccoli and 2 potatoes or whatever and the app will match the ingredients with a recipe that seems to be the closest. I mean there are a lot of people (like me) who have no idea what to do with the rest of the ingredients that are left over. And sometimes they just dont have the time to do groceries and would rather cook a quick meal with the things they already have at home.\nWhat do you think?	2019-09-10 16:59:29.312173
420	/startup-idea/a-better-self-supporting-nursing-home	Older people pay through the nose for care services, or often have to put up with care of a very low quality. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a home/a chain of community-based homes where younger members of the home could contribute to the services/running costs by vegetable gardening/keeping hens for eggs/cooking/washing up/knitting or painting or baking or jam-making to raise funds? This would give occupants a sense of purpose and usefulness and a sense of community, help to keep grocery costs down, keep occupants happier and healthier and give their relatives a peace of mind. A home of the kind would have to attract some younger pensioners in better health, of course, who are in good enough health to help.	2019-09-10 16:59:29.312173

This also gives people a conversation topic to talk after if both decide to go grab to eat or drink.	2019-09-10 16:59:29.312173
422	/startup-idea/intelligent-financial-advice-for-average-people	A personal finance app for lower income people.  The core feature of the application would be an intelligent system trained by a large financial dataset which will help lower income people determine how to allocate their money for best chances of financial success.  \nWhen signing up a user would provide current financial stats, projected income, bills they need to pay, etc..  They will also upload their goals, (for example, a goal could be, have $5000 in bank by December to by my son a car).  Users will always be able to check their projected chances of reaching a goal.\nUsers will be able to upload receipts, pay checks, bills directly to the app, and it will automatically readjust budgets and create a new projected chance of success.  They can also ask the app to reassess the chances of success if they were to make a certain financial decision before they do it.  Ie, ask the app to reevaluate their financial outlook if they were to purchase a $300 tv today.\nThere are a lot of financial planning apps for the wealthy, but few for the poor and middle class.  \nThis app is currently under development.  I appreciate any advice.  alex.wallish@gmail.com if you are interested in joining.	2019-09-10 16:59:30.108964

429	/startup-idea/shared-webshop	The idea is to develop a system and set of rules that would enable a group of loosely connected people to share a webshop. For instance, communities consisting of up to 1000 people will have a number of people selling or wanting to sell stuff on a hobby- or more professionel level. This is good for promoting both each seller and the community as a whole. Each person would be responsible for his/her "section" of the webshop.	2019-09-10 16:59:30.108964

435	/startup-idea/virtual-town-hall---crowdfunding-democracy	Politicians disconnected from the real life and corrupted by lobbies are a big problem everywhere. The Virtual Town Hall could bring democracy into every neighborhood and so make it more efficient. People could register according to their location, so that the decisions are made by those who know the circumstances and who will be affected be them. In the first stance it could be an election tool, detecting what people want for their neighborhood (similar to the European Pirate Party’s Liquid Democracy): For example a new playground. The second stage could be an actual petition, for which the site could collaborate with one of the many sites who already specialize in that. Thirdly it could be used to fund projects the state does not or can not fund, like the new playground. This is where a provision for the site and so revenue would come in.\nImportant for the project would be to have a offline kit of structures ready for those without internet: The possibility for phone or mail elections, or even ones organized by the community itself on the four eyes principle. Furthermore the word should be spread be print outs. Best would be a coordinator for every campaign. \n	2019-09-10 16:59:30.108964

443	/startup-idea/social-network-for-school-projects	When you're working in a group, not everyone always gives 100%. This app would change that by offering a review service for group members in group projects. Ideally, it would link to a school directory or Facebook account, and other students would be able to rate their members on different criteria such as attending meetings, completing work on time, working thoroughly, and communication. It could offer constructive criticism that only the recipient could see. The app could go in one of two directions: either a public directory so you could see who you want to work with (like a ratemyprofessors.com) or it could be solely for review and improving future group work based on feedback and criticism. It could also be used by teachers to get feedback on how individual members worked, which most teachers already do when the project is completed.	2019-09-10 16:59:30.926315

Installed applications are collected in a page to easily found them later (don't need to remember their URL). The system also recommends newest and hottest applications, but you can also search the database. Features like single sign on, payment and in app purchase can be also implemented.

Once this is done the company asks the customer location and if the customer explain well, the customer will get the taxi on the spot with somes delays depending on taxi distance.\nNow let me explain the big deal of it.\n1. There are times that the client does not know its location.\n2. Waste of time trying to explain the location.\n3. When this finally explain the location, the taxi company searches for the nearest taxi to you (this also takes time) and if has no taxi available, the customer must call another company and do it all again.\n\nWhat I want to do is develop a taxi network system that will work as follows:\n1. Client-side software containing all possible taxi of the current region within a certain radius.\n2. Companies-side Software web-based that controls all taxi company and receives customer orders and demand for the nearest taxi on your location (by GPS).\n3.

Sure, culture is culture- we all can understand values, beliefs, and general way of life is going to alter. However, since moving here I have seen numerous student suicides amongst young Hong Kongers. This only leads me to believe this added pressure in the education system and lack of "fun", "active"  childhood memories is to blame. I am not a counselor, nor any specialist of this related topic, but I am a teacher who holds a Bachelor of Science in Public Relations. I am passionate towards helping people. Let's change this. Let's create a simple social platform where likeminded individuals can ask for help without being afraid and speak openly about their problems, fears or discomforts.	2019-09-10 16:59:30.926315

This would be scrutinized for a realistic budget and time estimation by sanitation experts on the panel. Post approval, this will be displayed on the app as a project and would be linked to a convenient SEARCH OPTION based on location proximity. \nNow the people in that locality will be notified about this project to clean a space in their locality. Other nearby users can either be a part of the cleaning team or pledge an amount to support the equipment required to clean. Our team will partner with private and public players to ensure the delivery. Local NGOs and NPOs along with Municipal Bodies will be roped in.

There is a gazzilion of songs on youtube, but I don't have time to look for those I would like. There is a number of web radios that play music according to mood/style, but those don't really play mainstream music + you have to listen to whatever comes up. Within youtube playlists you would be able to select what you like to listen to.	2019-09-10 16:59:31.719107
456	/startup-idea/one-email-just-for-one-real-person	Usual problem when building a commercial website is to prevent users from creating several accounts with different email addresses and enjoy free demos. I believe there is huge potential for anyone who built an email service that would allow one real person to have only one email address. The commercial sites can then allow users only with this specific email like somebody@realperson.com. It must be very easy to setup and global as well though.	2019-09-10 16:59:31.719107

460	/startup-idea/shopping-window-as-a-screen-for-e-commerce	One of the disadvantages of the traditional offline shops is definitely limited opening hours.

463	/startup-idea/on-line-shopping-with-a-twist	There are lots 'non-branded' products which is special to region (like handicrafts, souvenirs etc).But often the producers of these products cant sell their produce to a larger audience because they are often technology illeterate,(which a branded product does with the help of access the internet ecommerce ,eg-ebay,amazon etc). Since we having the knowledge of internet ,cant we leverage and share our tech expertise with these local producers and use it to market their produce?\nHow to achieve this ??\nWell, i propose that we ask these local producers to own a smartphone with an app say whatsapp. These producers then take a picture of their product and the give a brief description about the  product (We train them how to do this using a set protocol) and send it to us.\nWe then input this info into our e-commerce website.Now when a consumer browses our site and wants to purchase a product  then that info is relayed to the producer.The producer then parcels the product to consumer using a parcel serivce.A fixed percentage of the price of product can be charged as our fees.So folks feel free to contact me and tell me what u think about this idea.	2019-09-10 16:59:31.719107

If you run 2 miles today, you can get a free bottle of Smartwater? Etc. Etc. It would be a website or an app, but the form of advertising would be somewhat extraordinary as the consumers are working towards the product itself.

At time of billing, particular Shopping Bag barcodes (one ore more) will get associated with articles purchased by customer.

473	/startup-idea/tour-guides-by-locals	Vacations organised by tour groups and companies are paid by organisations and sites to bring customers and revenue to them. \n\nWhy opt to be part of their moneymaking scheme, when you can have a genuine local do the best itineraries for you? Plenty of people are willing to bring tourists on sightseeing visits, and being locals they would have the perfect understanding of what are the attractions within their localities.\n\nCreate a web platform whereby locals can offer to build structured tour guides that are formed out of premade templates, tied into google maps and other features. On top of that, offer the chance for these locals to earn further money by providing the tour guide services themselves.\n\nUsers of the app would be able to find tour guides created by locals for them, paying little to nothing for great advice and opinions on what is the best things in a region.\n\n- This idea was originally posted on www.bizideahive.com, a website that provides FREE Business Ideas for you.

477	/startup-idea/lodgerhub	LodgerHub is a new game-changing platform that sits in between AirBnB and Hotels. \n\nWouldn't be great to rent a private apartment -just like on AirBnB- but with the peace of mind that it's backed by a well known hospitality brand (Hotel)? Wouldn't be great to be able to get access to additional hotel services like fresh towels, mini-bar, laundry, room-service or daily cleaning and at the same time, being treated as a hotel guest?\n\nLodgerHub takes AirBnB concept to the next level by adding Hotel services to Host properties, creating a superior guest experience.\n\nHosts list their properties on LodgerHub, Hotels choose to service any of those, and Guests book a private apartment serviced by a trusted Hotel brand.\n\nHosts gets peace of mind and professional management.\nGuests gets a superior experience and saves money.\nHotels regain market share, gets more visits and improve their brand image.\n\nThis concept is somehow similar to the well known condo-hotel business model, but with the difference that rooms/properties are not on the same building.\n	2019-09-10 16:59:32.551318

It create economies for the local, and make ease for the foreigner with less familiarity to the country's culture, places, and services available. example: A is a tourist who planned for ease of mobility to visit places in Bali.\nB is a local guy with free time, family car, and wanting to make some cash. B may advertise himself as "local tourist guide" and A may surf the web to find anything matching his  needs(car, mobility, efficiency), and found B.

Polypharmacy becomes problematic, dangerous, and ineffective when these drugs interacts with one another and/or contribute life threatening adverse events.  It becomes extremely difficult for pharmacists and physicians to intervene when multiple drugs are being dispensed at multiple pharmacies.  \n\nSolution:  A free mobile app that is built like financial accounts (ie. mint), to allow consumers to access all their prescriptions and medications when they are logged in.  Upon initial set up, ONEpharmacy will down all prescription data from associated pharmacy accounts (ie.

The problem is that I've been online dating for years, yet haven't been going on that many dates, or people email back and forth, and no dates are set up.  So, I would love a dating site that requires people to date, not just browse, yet go on real dates.	2019-09-10 16:59:39.732162

Some products you cant buy on your own country so you can give some iten from your country for an item of the other persons country. You can change itens by mathing a similar value and you are scored if all goes right if the people you are sending dont send to you back you can blacklist that user and others will not change with that person again. I should work for tiny things for example a pack of chocolates or simple things that you can find on a especific place but you will not need to be there to get the local iten.	2019-09-10 16:59:39.732162

I usually take the wrong one - it's sunny and warm, but there is wind and maybe rain comes soon so I am cold then or the temperature is not that hot but no wind and I am hot then. How about a weather app, that would suggest you the clothes - take jacket, shirt is enough etc. That's the information people are looking for.	2019-09-10 16:59:39.732162

But when I come across something interesting that requires more time to read or watch (like new photo album or video) I don't have time to go through it. When I come back it usually ends up deep in the news feed and I forgot what it was or who posted it. How about a small plugin to add Check later button?	2019-09-10 16:59:39.732162
515	/startup-idea/cheap-dates-on-demand-mobile-application	I know this may be a silly idea, yet sometimes I just want to go on a date right now, but not looking for someone who is going to charge a high price or require me to dress up. I want a date right away without the hassle of looking or searching for a long time, trying to woo the other person to date me or convince them that I'm a good guy.  I want it to be quick, easy, and someone to date nearby.  A mobile app where everyone on the site agrees to be a date on demand.  The service would require people to be interviewed, background checks would be held on every user, and the user would have to renew their background every year.  The only thing is that you would be required to be a dater on demand.	2019-09-10 16:59:39.732162
516	/startup-idea/mobile-hotels	Hotels that could be transported between events or places during times where rooms would be in high demand.  The rooms would be more like small pods with the basic necessities, maybe single/double bed, bathroom.  You could transport them on a semi truck trailer.  Could just stay there without unloading.  The water could be supplied by a large tank to all the rooms and you may have to ration it carefully if you're not near a good water source.  Sewage could go to a holding tank.  Once the event was over, or demand falls off, pack it up, change sheets, clean up, and truck it to the next place.  Always high occupancy!	2019-09-10 16:59:39.732162
517	/startup-idea/application-statistics-monitoring-as-a-service	Users would be owners of web apps.  They would expose a bunch of statistics via a URL on their site (ie www.somewebapp.com/stats).  Stats might be the number of emails queued for sending, the size of a queue of tweets which are being processed, or whatever.  The stats are then polled intermittently and monitored for unusual changes.  The user is then emailed to warn them of aberrations/anomalies.\n\nGetting a number out is trivial for the user; setting up monitoring on it maybe not so trivial for them to implement. Getting feedback when a new release breaks something could be critical.\n\nExposing status through a simple web service might make things compatible.  We should provide libraries for PHP, Java, .Net, JS, Ruby and users can use them to expose their status to you.  If we can produce a graphical front end to this data, which clients can visit to see whats up, great.	2019-09-10 16:59:39.732162
518	/startup-idea/kinect-fu	Lots of people have learned dance moves they would otherwise have never known without having purchased Dance Central on the XBox 360 and Kinect.  The Kinect is capable of making observations about the orientation and form of the body as it moves and adjusts in real time.  This also makes it ideal as an instructional tool for Kung Fu, Karate and other martial arts.\n\nThe Kinect could be an excellent instructor both in terms of teaching the user various Kata or forms, as well as being a merit based system that would understand and acknowledge mastery without prejudice or reservation.  If you can perform the moves with accuracy and from memory, you rise a belt.    Additional peripherals such as a punching dummy could be sold as well that would allow the xbox to gauge how hard you can punch and move in relation to a "real" opponent. \n\nThis would be ideal for those who want to learn self defense, but don't have the time or inclination to do it in front of a large group of people.	2019-09-10 16:59:39.732162

520	/startup-idea/ninjapages---quick-and-fast-html5-page-deployment	As a web developer, I find it hard to easily host my static html files online for my colleagues to see. I need to use my own vps or an app deployment service (like heroku), however, these services are bulky, time consuming, and primarily meant for heavily programmed apps. Ninjapages fills this gap, and provides a service where a developer can easily deploy his/her static website online and under a subdomain, like (mysite.npages.com). Ninjapages is an idea I've been thinking of for a while, but the actual development of the idea has been limited. The user will upload their files from their local machine or even code their site in the html5 editor on the website. Also, there is a mobile application that runs along with the website. Within the mobile app, the user can code the website directly in the UI and deploy the site from the mobile iPhone/Android app.	2019-09-10 16:59:41.484995

522	/startup-idea/somethingaday	A social network similar where people post one thing that they learnt each day. There is a character limit of say 200 on what you can post and it simply comes up in the feed as a speech bubble from that person. People can then vote whether they already knew this, or if it is new to them. Aside from the main feed there will then be a 'leaderboard' of sorts with the most unknown things that people have learnt.\n\nto attract customers you could offer financial incentives to those who provide accurate facts that nobody else knows.\nmoney could be made from advertising?\n\nwhat else could be added to make people more involved? perhaps the ability to follow up with that person and find out how they learnt it?	2019-09-10 16:59:41.484995

525	/startup-idea/earning-money-by-rating-apps-in-app-play-store	A good position in the ranking of apps in app stores is very important for companies that write and sell apps. For a good ranking its important to have a lot of downloads and good reviews.\nSo why don't make an app, that people say "download this app, rate it in the store and get x euro for it"?\nCompanies or owners of app will get downloads and ratings and, if the app is good, the app will rise in the ranking. \nThe user's rating of the app has to be honest.	2019-09-10 16:59:41.484995
526	/startup-idea/voizr---a-social-network-for-voices	There are thousands of articles all over the internet that are uploaded daily.  Sometimes people don't have the time or undivided attention to read all the new information.  So instead of having the user read the article, there can be an option to stream an audio recording of the clip.  In addition to the share buttons on article pages, there can be a voizr button for an audio recording for the article.  The recordings will be made by people on the network who would like to share their voice and every article would have multiple voices for the user to choose from. Article authors could have a list of voice talent they use consistently or have their own voice talent added to a favourites list. There could even be monetization set up with audio ads like on the radio which could be split with the voice talent.  An app for mobile phones could also have a listen later option to download the clip and listen offline anytime.	2019-09-10 16:59:41.484995

531	/startup-idea/online-education-video-aggregator-development	Background: There has been a surge in the past few years of online education tools, primarily third party videos like those from Khan Academy, PatrickJMT, iTunesU, and from institutions like MIT with open courseware.\n\nProblem: Some of these videos are high quality; however, one must weed through many videos, which may contain extraneous information. Videos for higher-level classes do not exist in a high quality format. Some institutions offer videos, however one seldom finds a video with good audio, video, as well as a good professor.\n\nSolution: My idea is a website, which aggregates and creates material for all level courses. High quality, preexisting videos for lower level courses would be vetted and arranged in a cogent manner, cutting down on choices, as well as matched up with popular textbooks, so students could easily find a suitable match. Videos for high-level courses would be created, and paired to popular textbooks. Practice problems and review questions could also be easily added.	2019-09-10 16:59:41.484995

539	/startup-idea/mediday	Millions of people across the world take medication on a daily basis. There are apps out there that give you push notifications or SMS reminder services - but they all have a flaw.\n\nExisting reminder options require user input and if that user forgets to update the system in line with changes to their prescription, then medication reminders aren't relevant to their required medical routine. \n\nMediDay aims to solve that problem. MediDay is a web based application that 'plugs into' doctor or pharmacy systems to enable medication reminders to be sent to patients by SMS, email and/or push notifications. \n\nThis means doses of medication aren't missed, appointments with doctors aren't missed and the correct medication is taken at the right time. \n\nThis could be licenceed to doctors or medical groups and given free to patients, and/or the other way around.\n\nI would be interested in hearing from anyone interested in the project! Feel free to communicate on this idea page or email me: davidjscotford(at)hotmail.co.uk \n\nThanks for reading - let's make sure people never miss taking their medication ever again.	2019-09-10 16:59:42.595516

545	/startup-idea/shifting-computer-mouse-for-carpal-tunnel	The problem is repetitive injury/carpal tunnel that happen with overuse of hand and arm, overtaxing the tendons and nerves. The result is pain, numbness, tingling, etc. in the hand and arm which could lead to surgery to alleviate the symptoms. One way I have been addressing is through my computer mouse. There are many different kinds and I have tried several. But, these devices can continue the repetitive motion. I would like to see a computer mouse that utilizes several different technologies and automatically shifts the user through them during the day to keep different tendons and nerves in play.	2019-09-10 16:59:42.595516

564	/startup-idea/directional-alarm-clock	Problem :\nCouple have different sleep timing but often woken up by partner's alarm clock.\n\nExisting solution(http://bit.ly/OHGNB1) is using wristwatch/ring/bangle that send small electrical shock to wake you up, but I think this is very impractical and I guess most of us don't like to wear anything like that when sleeping.\n\nMy solution is using directional speaker(search "BBC - Audio Spotlight " in Youtube) which concentrate sound to very specific area. While your partner might still hear some sound due vibration and reflection, it still not as bad as common alarm clock.Also directional speaker is cheap now especially from AliBaba or any Chinese manufacturer.\n\nI think this idea can get high gain(publicity/exposure/financing) using crowdfunding platform such as Kickstarter.com\n\nI need cofounder that can do design and actual product prototyping and connection with manufacturing company(especially in China). I've done some rough sketch around this idea.	2019-09-10 16:59:44.554561

567	/startup-idea/open-mic-nights	I'd like to see an app/website where musicians could find places to turn up and play within a defined radius of any location.\n\nMusicians and venues are useless at maintaining lists of open mic nights, so this would have to be community-maintained.\n\nIt would invite reviews and be easy to join and update collectively. E.g. I see a regular open mic night on Tuesdays at 8pm at venue 'x'. I turn up and find out next week they're putting on a tribute band instead, so I quickly add a note to the 'calendar'. I don't want to see to 'The Beatalls' or 'Bled Zeppelin', so I send out a message asking if anyone knows another open mic on Tuesdays, or a suitable venue where we could persuade them to host one.\n\nOver time, the regular events accumulate and there's a one-stop source of info about where I can play on any given night in any location.	2019-09-10 16:59:44.554561

Well this would make this b in your own home \n\nI am proposing a website that when you log on or make an account you can make an avatar of your self and walk round and shop.But the mall would be open to any business because in shopping malls small type stores cant afford the rent of a unit and it would give small busineses the chance of selling from their store but also on line with out the fees of setting up there own website.\n\nProfit could be made by a small fee for (rent of a store/unit) or advertising.\n	2019-09-10 16:59:44.554561
570	/startup-idea/business-tips-via-audio-on-your-mobile-phone	There seem to be a growing number of business tips websites using the interview format, which showcase the stories and strategies of successful entrepreneurs. Some examples include Mixergy, Growth Hacker TV, and Foundville. \n\nWhile these sites offer a wealth of great knowledge, the problem is that most busy entrepreneurs, while interested in learning, simply don't have the time to listen to these interviews since they are too busy running their OWN businesses.\n\nThe solution: Make it easier for these busy people to listen to these interviews during a time of day when they most likely do have time available...in their car. \n\nBy creating a mobile website/app which aggregates content from these various sources and making them available as audio clips that are easily playable through your mobile device, busy founders can now have access to a wide library of tips at a time of day where they are most likely to have the time to listen. \n\nThis service would also create a "profile" of each subscriber, delivering timely, relevant types of audio interviews for them i.e. SEO, web marketing, sales, etc.	2019-09-10 16:59:44.554561

593	/startup-idea/virtual-market-place-for-market-research	Many companies pay for a lot for market research. They utilize it and usually have no much use for it afterwards. At the same time, they might be willing to sell it after some time and thus recover part of their costs. Other companies can also be willing to buy a research that might not 100% fit their need and be a bit outdated, but would cost them 10% of the price they would pay to a market research agency.	2019-09-10 16:59:46.769058

Aged patients needs more healthcare effort due to increase in cases of chronic illnesses involving higher costs.\nSuggested Solution is simply having sensors attached to the body to constantly monitor vital body signs (temperature, pressure, ECG, pulse, oxygen level, etc). The sensor should be in form of a wearable devices (Shirts, caps and wrist watch). Readings from the sensors are then sent to a website which logs, analyze and generate a report based on some set conditions(Expert Systems). The generated report is then sent to the doctor daily, weekly or hourly depending on how critical the situation of the patient is.	2019-09-10 16:59:44.554561

Or you go and it's just so crowded that there's a line out-the-door and you'll never get in or get a table or seat at the bar. Or the cover charge is just too much. Or you'd rather just watch the goings on there virtually, in a private, perhaps more intimate, setting.\n\nEnter the "Know Before You Go" livestream website aggregator/search engine of high-quality webcam from bars, nite clubs, restaurants, etc. The livestreams would be accessible by visitors to our site for free.

578	/startup-idea/cheapest-itinerary-for-a-multi-city-trip	Hi guys, I am building a startup that focuses on providing the cheapest trip by finding the best combination of routes you can take to make that trip. For example, if you want to go to London, Berlin and Rome, which itinerary would be the cheapest? Starting at London going to Rome and then to Berlin or the other way around? Would that change if you took the trip at a different time of the year? What about adding accommodation to the equation, would that change the results?<br><br>Even in this simple example, there are many possible ways to visit the very same places and for the multicity budget traveler the best option would frequently be the one that costs less regardless of other details.<br><br>The route search we are currently building will find the best itinerary for you considering all those factors, but our MVP will include only flights for Europe. <br>What do you guys think about this idea? Do you think it solves a real problem? What do you consider to be the early adopter of this solution?<br><br>Would like to hear your thoughts on this matter.<br>Thank you all!	2019-09-10 16:59:45.904732

Then other people can come and make their own branch, add to it, and I can merge the changes if I like it. The idea being that collectively people can create very interesting (and unpredictable) stories.<br>All stories will be by default published with the MIT license aka no-one can exclusively claim copyright including the person who came up with the idea. Maybe down the road if people want to monetize the the book a formula (say based on the percentage of words written by each contributor) can be used to determine individual royalties.	2019-09-10 16:59:46.769058
581	/startup-idea/online-health-medical-service	We lose so much of our time and effort for getting general health&medical service. We do these things like appointment with medical professional, waiting for medical check up,then medical test of blood,sugar,urine, x-ray etc from different labs and again re appointment with all test report for getting prescription, go to medical stores, waiting for medicine, again consult with pharmacist for doses. This process again to be continued when we go for next check up. If we have multiple health problems then we face more problems in multiple prescriptions. If we design and process entire system online so that we can book appointment, visual consult online  with medical professionals, contact labs for taking blood, urine (if we have our staying nearby it they could collect it from our homes) or taking x-ray for reports. Then doctor should direct us to make more test or physical meeting to him. If we have our soft profile of medical history we need not visit each time to healthcare. Medical Store can pack getting prescription online and inform us whether they send to us or we collect it there. Pharmacist can guide our doses and medicines. We should pay for each service online.	2019-09-10 16:59:45.904732

Things get even more difficult  when living in small areas. Also there is not a platform that focuses only on covers and promotes recognition.\n\nSolution: an app where musicians could record 25 second riff ideas. Then with Geo-localization like tinder you could sort through musicians near you and connect and form a band.\n\nTop engaging and most viral riffs could be displayed in a rank by region. Also a place where musicians could post their covers and get recognition and awards by other musicians.	2019-09-10 16:59:45.904732

586	/startup-idea/find-the-right-school	Independent research analysis states, around 20% population of any developing nation belongs to migrant category, i.e. they keep relocating between cities/countries along with family.\nOne of the major challenge of this community has been to search for the best school in the new location. \nEven though Google provides this information to some extent, parents do not find a single consolidated site where this information is provided in a streamlined fashion.\nMy idea is to develop a website portal, that enables parents to search schools, read reviews, post reviews, interact with other parents in the forum. Sites such as Zomato and Yelp followed similar business model for Restaurants and acheived great heights. I have fully developed a prototype and currently looking for Co-founders mostly developers, SEO specialist, content writers for my website.	2019-09-10 16:59:45.904732
587	/startup-idea/app-idea-to-connect-people	the problem with today is that everyone is so connected, but no one is truly connected in a personal sense. i have an idea for an app that brings people together and allows people to meet new people while doing activities that they love. for example, you want to join a local running club but don't know anyone around doing that. you could post a running club and using geolocation (like tinder, and other dating apps use) you could find or post different activities to partake in. would be a true social media in every sense.	2019-09-10 16:59:45.904732

589	/startup-idea/a-proofreading-service-for-students	ProofMe is an app under construction that connects people who are prepared to proofread academic papers to students. A fee, determined by the proofreader, will be charged to the student. An upper limit will be set so that the service remains affordable. Proofreaders will be asked to provide supporting documentation as to why they are eligible to proofread papers - similar to the AirBnB 'vetting process'. Various minimum requirements will be enforced. Proofreaders will read through students' papers and make corrections and/or provide advice on any improvement they feel could me made to the assignment. Once feedback has been received, students will rate their proofreader according to certain criteria - This rating (out of 5 stars) will be reflected on the proofreader's profile. Papers will be categorised by grade level or academic year (E.g.: 'Grade 11 English').  We see this as not only being profitable and highly rewarding for those who get involved as proofreaders but also an immensely valuable tool for students across the globe - especially ESL students.	2019-09-10 16:59:45.904732

Actually, if you can set what you want to hear or not depending on the situation, that would be really cool. Shut everything up, but still be able to hear your baby crying.	2019-09-10 16:59:46.769058
595	/startup-idea/humormeter	What about having a site where you post a joke/picture/video to test how funny it is? Could be not only fun but also useful tool for marketing agencies if it has possibility to filter results by the audience (age, gender, location etc.)	2019-09-10 16:59:46.769058
596	/startup-idea/no-more-keys	I have so many keys, Car key, House key's, Office key's.

Just a brown coffee pill that is about the size of an Aspirin, but it is instant coffee.	2019-09-10 16:59:46.769058

602	/startup-idea/is-server-sending-email-to-ppls-spam-folders	Build a service that allowed users to send an email from their server to 100's of email addresses that you have setup via yahoo, gmail, etc. And then after the email is sent your script logs to all those email accounts test to see what went into spam.\n\nThen report the results back to the owner. Your service could ping a script, that you made, on their server to send the emails. \n\nWhen they signup to your service they install your script - email-ping.php - on their server and then they enter the location of email ping script into your saas control panel.\n\nAdd a nice bright and colorful stats dashboard and it would be a winner. Definitely worth $9.95 month.	2019-09-10 16:59:46.769058
603	/startup-idea/keyword-based-chatrooms	It's basically a Chat, where every Keyword Combination has his own automatic Chatroom.\nExample: (Your City) + Volleyball\nSo could find easily many Volleyball players in your City and talk about it or meet to play with them.\nIt's actually a good addition to my first idea, but it could even work as a single idea.

604	/startup-idea/internet-puppeteering-engine	Since Google have pretty much dumped a lot of content farms from their Panda release, we'll need the next "big thing" on greyhat SEO techniques to successfully gain visibility of our new ventures.\n\nFurthermore, it looks like Google is starting to score social involvement in its page rankings, visible from how it displays those parameters in Analytis. In other words, Google may be counting links from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc when calculating its page rankings.\n\nI propose having an army of internet drones that can be commanded to "talk" about a web page or promote a page among themselves and their immediate human peers (those gullible enough to not know that they're friending a bot) to promote a site in the search engines. \n\nThese drones are a set of internet "personas" that have facebook, twitter, quora, and other social networking sites and are somewhat actively involved in those social networking sites. They will make a certain low number of "idle" posts by default, but can be commanded to talk about a site or a topic when the need arises.\n\nThis idea is a pretty common theme in the field of high frequency trading & we're bringing it to Internet Marketing.	2019-09-10 16:59:48.491123
605	/startup-idea/portable-supercomputer	Used first, second and third generation iPhones all have a few things in common.  First, they all have processors that are superior to anything built pre-2003.  Second, they share a wifi connection.  Third, they are being disposed of as useless and can be picked up for almost nothing.  Finally, they can all be jailbroken to run a version of linux with any kind of small application cluster. \n\nWhat if you could take a hundred of these old phones, outfit them with a version of linux that supports a distributed computing platform, and then daisychain them all to a power/USB cable (yes, power them all over USB).  Connect them all to a Raspberry Pi, Arduino or gadgeteer controller and then run distributed computing applications that used wifi or blue tooth as a local communications layer. \n\nNew nodes would be as easy to add as carrying another suitcase of these phones into a room with an existing cluster.  \n\nBest of all, because they all have their own batteries, the cluster could operate for short periods of time (hours) in environments that have inconsistent or unsustained power grids.	2019-09-10 16:59:48.491123
606	/startup-idea/methodology-for-measuring-career-happiness	You need money up to a certain level and from then on marginal increases in financial wealth have increasingly diminishing positive impact to your happiness level. Yes, Abraham Maslow discovered this and this have been re-proven by many experimenters like Dan Ariely and Dan Pink.\n\nIt would be great if there is a framework for objectively assessing and measuring and finally come into a conclusion whether you should continue on your career or seek another path for your own advancement and mental well-being. The framework then should also help in making a well-informed decision on which step to go next.\n\nI've been toying on a variation of  BCG's Growth-Share Matrix as a method for assessing how money and happiness correlates in your job. Ideally things like this should be pluggable to a more comprehensive framework like the balanced scorecard.	2019-09-10 16:59:48.491123

I am aware of some initiatives concerned with car sharing but they are imo not effective. It would be great to lower traffic density with all its positive effect perhaps by a new way of car-sharing that works.	2019-09-10 16:59:51.86741
607	/startup-idea/git-client-for-ipad	There many git apps for regular computers that saves you from the command line. However options for the iPad is seriously lacking.\n\nWhy? Likely because in iOS data are generally private to each application that manages it.\n\nBut what if the data are on a server?\n\nFor example you have this git repository on a Linux server that you also use for compiling and running the application. Sometimes you like to make some edits, a few commits, or even resolve merge conflicts between co-workers. \nYou would like do this while you're on the road maybe don't have a place to sit down and put your laptop on your lap. An iPad is the best for use in these situations.\n\nYes, yes, you could fire up ssh to run vim or emacs on the server and use command-line git.\n\nBut if you bought an iPad, wouldn't you prefer some nice looking GUI interface? It'll saves you some typing and perhaps makes working with servers slightly more pleasant when you're chugging along at 80 Kph on a cross-country train with a spotty 3G connection?\n\nHow about a Git shell that connects through ssh to your favorite server and doesn't make you wait between keystrokes when you're not on broadband? A real Git app that runs on your iPad.\n	2019-09-10 16:59:48.491123
608	/startup-idea/lets-save-energy-cheapest-air-con-substitute	I am renting a flat, so I can't improve conditions of this place as much as I want to. I am not an owner of this property I temporarily live in.\nThe sun hits my window directly, so I found some eco solution to keep heat out of window for only 1 coin. It is working well (so I don't need to buy an air conditioner), but it looks worse than anything else (so that feature will have to be improved - but I've got an idea how to do it as well).\nThe market for this idea will be huge, because lots of people:\n- suffer from direct sun light,\n- are renting flats;\n- can't afford air conditioner;\n- want to save energy, money.\nSo I'm looking for sponsor or arbiter for this idea.	2019-09-10 16:59:48.491123
609	/startup-idea/death-insurance	Death Insurance\n\nPeople get less kids and acquire wealth they take to the grave, or even have something like nice house but not the money they need to live a life nice with. There should be a way of selling stuff while you live for the time after you die, but still be able to use it as long as you are alive.\n\nThe death insurance could let people sell things and get the price as a sort of salary in advance. Take the house: Sell it when you are 60. You can still use it as long as you live or up to a fixed time. Meanwhile you get a monthly share of the houses price as a sort of salary. The owner and the buyer can agree individually if its a fixed loan, if the price gets paid in full at the beginning or in parts, or a professional employee of the company could estimate the value and salary as insurance consultants usually do.\n\nNaturally the house would be sold cheaper than what its worth. The business model is the same as insurances have but in reverse. \n	2019-09-10 16:59:48.491123
610	/startup-idea/app-that-recognize-number-and-letters-in-a-photo	So I came up  with this idea for a app or program which allows you to take a pics of any object with numbers or letters on it.  The app would act as a scanner. It would read and recognize a phone in the picture or a the name of a company or business on the side of a building in the picture. The app would allow to call the number in the photo or Google the name of the company in the photo.	2019-09-10 16:59:48.491123
611	/startup-idea/customized-coding-computer-adaptive-learning	Basically, this is an online learning environment for coding that meets your skill-set wherever you may be. You start off with about 100 questions to assess your subjective skills. Using predictive modeling, you start a lesson that hopefully matches your skill level. At first, you may start with a lesson that is too easy or too hard and the computer learns from this and sends you down to an easier lesson or up to a more difficult lesson. \n\nThe more users, the better the predictive algorithims. \n\nThere's room tons of social, content marketing as well as gameification. Plus, when users get good enough, they can start working on low-level programs from companies.\n\nCompanies can then assess skills and make hiring decisions.\n\n\n\n	2019-09-10 16:59:48.491123

613	/startup-idea/missed-call-as-an-alternative-to-otp	Over the time we have seen there were several protocols introduced over web for customer identity verification OR human verification. <br><br>The most famous were Captcha and SMS One Time Password based verification. But these solutions do not just have loop holes but at the same time are costly too ( as the normal sms sending costs about 1-5 Cents per sms )<br><br>So the overall idea is to build a Missed call based alternative to OTP and Captcha ( which would not just help in building a cleaner and trusted user-base but would be cost effective too, resulting in 85-90% cost cutting for SMBs )	2019-09-10 16:59:48.491123
614	/startup-idea/rent-luggage-space	You are going back home from your holiday, and you start packing. You then realize that you have overbought your things! Your baggage exceeds the maximum limit wayy too much. You go online to check the excess baggage fees, and you realize you could buy a plane with that amount. \n\nWhat do you do?\n\nHere is the solution: an app where people can rent their baggage space. So for example if I am going Singapore (where I live) from Thailand, I log in, and check if there is anyone going Singapore. More details are in my head. This can be used in other purposes too. For example, if someone is coming to your country from country A, and you need something from there, this someone could be your delivery man!

Our world is becoming ever-more-connected and opportunity is wherever you want it to be. I have created an on-line business platform (about 80% - 85% done) for local businesses that will allow them to collaborate with foreign markets using a wide variety of tools and features. European countries are beginning to look for opportunities in other markets as is South America. Who’s to say that a business idea in Germany wouldn’t work in Brazil with the right people involved? Canada, the United States, Australia are among a few countries with great small to medium size businesses wanting to find a way to expand.

621	/startup-idea/real-life-dating-app-location-based	Let´s create a very simple mobile phone app that you activate if your single (or not but are on the lookout anyway). Just a few parameters: gender, what gender you are interested in and a selfie (mandatory, no more than 30 days old). The parameter set and your location will be transmitted to a database and everyone else with the app will be able to browse through a catalog of users with close location (200 yards). Add a blocking and invitation filter where while browsing you can go "invisible" to anyone you don´t fancy and can give a "green light" to anyone you´d like to meet. Stop it there (no chat or messaging functions) and let real life take it from there. Does improve the "batting average" though as you´d not try to chat up anyone not interested or in a relation. Should be easy to program and set up but would need a critical mass to get started. but that could be overcome by locaized promotion... Imagine: seeing someone nice/interesting somewhere (train, caffee, bar, campus) and getting a green light... no more wondering about missed opportunities.

That way, not only do the patients have the opportunity to help others with their own recuperation, but those who go hungry get access to food. What do you think ?

623	/startup-idea/talent-showcase-social-media	the entertainment industry is one of the most lucrative and biggest in the business. companies and business pay huge money to find the newest talent and the next best thing. What if we created a social media platform that resembled a Facebook but SPECIFICALLY for inspiring singers, rappers and dancers where they can upload their work and show case their talents. i know your thinking youtube, but what if record executives and talent agents can use this site specifically to search for new talent, instead of searching through millions of videos of people talking to their cats and jumping off ladders and useless stuff. think about American Idol, X factor and the voice MILLIONS of people try out each year and millions just to see a total of 12 judges, so picture how many people would sign up to see showcase their talent and try to get in touch with every major executive out there. All it would take is for one person like a Justin Bieber to get discovered and every person inspiring to become an entertainer will sign up and every, talent manager and record executive will be searching this daily. message me if you want to link up and help me create this	2019-09-10 16:59:49.858834
624	/startup-idea/beer-delivery	This is a simple idea, which might be very difficult to accomplish. The app/company is simple: There is always people who are too lazy to get out of their house to get alcohol for the night. Maybe the liquor store is too far from their house, and they have no car available. So people order the type of drink they want/need for the night directly from their phone and it is delivered on the door. There could also be extra features like snacks/chasers delivered as well.

Most of the one related to history are generally static images or at most some text embedded in a horizontal or vertical scroller\n\nIDEA\nThe idea is to combine both and create a TIMELINE MAP. Obviously its not possible for any individual or group of individuals to create such a map. The solution would be to allow users add data, draw on map for boundaries of empires at a point of time. Add tags and so on.\n\nVISUALIZATION\nThe map be exactly like google map but with additional tool like zoom-in/out time-up/down which enables the user to scroll through time and check any portion of map on any scale to know who ruled there, what was significant event that happened at that time or which battle took place.\n\nLet me know, if you are interested to work on such a project.	2019-09-10 16:59:51.017586

In 2010 when the crowdfunding sites came out i noticed that they did not cater to franchises, si i wrote my own idea/concept but just held on to it, now i noticed a couple sites catering to franchises, but i think my idea is better. \nCrowdchise would allow communities to vote and donate $20.00 to have start-ups or existing franchise units that would create jobs and be benificial to the community. Once funding is met individuals can regester to qualify to own/run a unit in their community cast free, and just pay regular royalties.\nThe founders of crowdchise would charge a small royalty fee to the parent company for each unit established through the site.\nIts a moltiple win situation. If anybody thinks this is a liable business idea im looking for partners.	2019-09-10 16:59:51.017586
637	/startup-idea/sms-system-for-schools-to-post-bulletins	Paper notes that come home from school often get lost and are not always easy to remember to send back. Schools should make this paperless so you can sign and submit everything online.	2019-09-10 16:59:51.017586
652	/startup-idea/questions-based-customer-service	We have a customer service both online and over the phone. The problem is people keep asking the same questions again and again even if it is all written on the site. Would be great if there was a system where people ask questions instead of search queries. After sending the question the system would automatically show similar questions with the answer and only if the user doesn't find the answer it let him send it to email support.	2019-09-10 16:59:51.86741
925	/startup-idea/jeans-up	I think everyone would have at least 2 pieces of jeans in the closet. But sometimes it's not enough or maybe sometimes you can't wear it anymore. So I think it would be nice to have an app or website that we can exchange or sell all type of jeans (shirt, trousers, shorts, suit, etc.) both first hand and second hand.	2019-09-10 17:00:56.488019
638	/startup-idea/child-day-care-babysitting	Hi Folks, I have seen many parents struggling to find a best Day care in their budget for their babies and are very worried about the child care in neighborhood. \n\nSo my solution is to list all the days cares, creches, playschools and kindergartens and share their rating based on services each one have respectively and parents reviews & comments. Which can be easily searched by area or switching on gps.\n\nOnce a parent is satisfied by any listen he can make the payment online and Schedule a appointment. Upon admission Parents can see Daily progress of child and track it, In & Out timings , Caretaker Present, Realtime pick n drop tracking, anytime CCTv access. \n\nAll other day cares which will be in low rating will uplift their standards and babies will be in safer hand thereafter.\n\nSecond Phase, we will introduce Babysitting.

Maybe you are lazy or physically unable to do so. \n\nWith this service, you would never have to worry about the inconvenience that is having to take out the trash. For $2 a week, the "bin movers" would come each day prior to garbage and recycling day and move your bins without you having to leave the comfort of your home. This service can be a great aid to the elderly, as going out to move the bins can be difficult.	2019-09-10 16:59:51.017586

Thanks to this the app (we can call it "Rank me") you can take a photo in dress cabin, send it and wait for some feedback from others... and based on this you can decide if you buy that dress or not. \nMore you rank others, the more will others rank you, etc.. \n\nI think its very good idea and needs to be created.	2019-09-10 16:59:51.017586
641	/startup-idea/unbiased-news	If we could create a plate form that could streamline several news sources,we could focus on a compare and contrast approach. Consumers would be able to look at the same story from different perspectives and could compare and contrast. This collection of information would allow for different perspectives  on the same event. It would force consumers to take in information from a purer standpoint,breaking down their preconceived bias and building a larger picture. My goal would be to change people from taking in news from sources that fit their biases and help build how they view the world,to absorbing information without said bias.<br>	2019-09-10 16:59:51.017586
642	/startup-idea/a-web-application-to-create-web-applications	Something like wix for web apps. People would be able to create dashboards, forms and views (grids, tables, etc) and create relationship between data (like in real databases). Everything would be made entirely within the platform and people would be able to create complex database  driven web applications that fit their exact needs. This platform would retire spreadsheets entirely for some companies that would like a custom solution to store and retrieve their data.	2019-09-10 16:59:51.017586
643	/startup-idea/digitization-medical-history	Imagine this, a person who has a disease that he/she is facing for a long time and is getting treatment for years on end. Do you not think that having a digital copy of all the medical record attached to some form of identification on a database would be very helpful for that person who is seeking medical help and has to travel all around the country for his treatment rather than carrying all documents with him/her, misplacing them and having no record of it at all. I would like to pitch an idea to make such a database and clubbing it with an app so that all the medical history of that patient is recorded and there is no fear of losing valuable data.<br><br>this could also help doctors keep track of all the prior medication and treatments given to the patient as well as the all the test results so that a lot of resources are saved by the patient and most importantly time and money.	2019-09-10 16:59:51.017586

645	/startup-idea/an-app-for-swapping-cars	Hi. \nI got this idea after I noticed the open niche. Swapping cars is a niche that is currently  not being explored much. My idea is to have an app that allows individuals to swap their cars when they want a change. The app will have options to set distance, transmittion, price range etc. I've had a look at the number of traffic available  every month in this niche and it's well over 1M. I'm looking to for co founders . 1 Person/agency  who can code and  another for Marketing. No money involved until we launch the app, just time investment needed for now.

650	/startup-idea/semantic-tag-connector-api	When people tag items (on YouTube, Delicious even IdeasWatch) they provide usually quite specific tag (like HTML5). Would be great if anyone created an API you could use on your site to add automatically some more tags to your "items" (videos, bookmarks, ideas) based on their semantic connection - e.g. add to tag HTML5 also webdesign and IT. This would make the search much easier - when you search for IT videos it would also find video about HTML5 even if the user didn't add specifically this tag.	2019-09-10 16:59:51.86741
651	/startup-idea/facebook-friends-travel-map-	When I plan a trip to another country I would like to know who of my friends was there too so he/she can give me some hints what to see and when to be careful. I think a Facebook app can do that (at least look into your photo albums to search for the name of the country) or maybe people would have to add list of countries they visited manually. People usually like to talk about their travel experiences so I don't think they would have a problem to enable the app to see where they have been.	2019-09-10 16:59:51.86741

668	/startup-idea/study-wagers	Just as people tend to enter a fitness club contract with lofty goals and self-motivation, for most of us that motivation does not last.  The same with our self-improvement plans.  We start strong, but too many people do not continue to meet goals.\nIn my vision (which you might change), we would provide a mobile and PC-based gambling site - where people bet that they will achieve various goals, mainly those set up in external sites - for study and self-improvement.  This would be similar, but far further than http://fitsby.com/ \nI am an experienced bootstrapped social media tool project founder, and will reply to serious inquiries from those who wish to partner with me on this.

Where all house wives can tell us that today what they are going to cooked, , we will publish they on our website, call center, while consumer (customer) will reach us through our website, app, call center, can select the food from the menu and order us and we will take the home made  food and deliver it.	2019-09-10 16:59:53.66259

683	/startup-idea/community-emergency-response-platform	A web and app-based community application for local communities to utilise communication technology to better respond to emergencies (in particular natural disasters). Alerts are sent out to community members during emergencies through SMS, mobile app alerts and telephone response systems that allow community members to easily provide responses that advise on their safety status and actions plans. In the case of a wild fire, a community member receiving an app alert can easily advise that they are 'OK' from a list of options, and that they are 'Evacuating immediately'. A community administrator can easily see the current status of hundreds of community members from a monitoring console and offer assistance or alert emergency services where the responses require it (or if there is no response at all).\nThe system will assist rather than replace the roles of the emergency services and allow for effective community action and mobility when time is of the essence. It greatly improves on old-fashioned 'telephone-tree' models of community response.	2019-09-10 16:59:53.66259

However, the major bottleneck I see in this is the high capital cost. \n\nSolution:\nIn order to promote installation of Solar Panels, the best solution possible is to have the best financial solution possible. What I want to do is that the Solar company should install the Panels at their own cost on the customers roof and sell the electricity at a fixed cost with a certain escalation. This will resolve the problem for high upfront investment for the consumers and promote green energy.	2019-09-10 16:59:53.66259

688	/startup-idea/help-me	How about focusing on security?\nAn application that will be configured to accept all relevant info in case of emergency such as  person to contact, number, police number, etc. The program shall work in such a way that when it is clicked, it will get the coordinates of your location (forcing the GPS to be turned on), then open the camera, shoot 15 seconds video of wherever the phone's camera is pointed, record audio to verify what's happening to you, and transmit all of these to the cloud.  The person to contact in case of emergency will be notified of these information.  The sending of the video/ audio to the cloud should be protected, meaning it can no longer be intercepted by anyone.  What are your thoughts?  I believe that we are back to the basics, and security being one of the basic needs should be prioritized. Let's work on this idea!	2019-09-10 16:59:54.750799

This will be the first app that effectively integrates all shopping methods including; mobile, social media, blog, website and in-store. Another unique feature of Mall is that it enables entertainers to make commission on in-store and online sales they influence. This will increase their income and their presence will attract more users since their fans will want to follow them for fashion inspiration and to explore their wardrobes. Moreover, many social media users spend hours gaining a large number of followers and this app will enable them to monetise those followers by just sharing what they buy. Furthermore, Mall enables fashion retailers to reach their customers through multiple channels and market to potential customers nearby in real-time.

694	/startup-idea/out-for-laughs	Every one could do with more laughter in their lives. In this App people could either upload or stream live videos in which they have 1 minute max' to try and make people laugh. As people watch the video the App uses facial recognition software and the camera on the phone to detect if they laugh. Videos will then be automatically rated by % of people that laughed at it. The videos could then be grouped 'funniest of the day/week'. Users would setup profiles so you could view other videos by people you found funny. Competitions could also be run for example 'most laughs obtained in week' in which it would take in to account all videos uploaded that week by a user and the amount of people they reached and made laugh. Profiles would also be setup for the users that watch the videos and the app would record how easy they to make laugh and at what kind of things the laugh to, this would allow video recommendations to be made and reputations to be build 'The hardest person to make laugh' or this person laughed more then any body else this week. To keep the app fresh there could also be a theme each week.	2019-09-10 16:59:54.750799

I am not sure if all small business owners realize that this page and data exists. I think this data can be really valuable, but I understand that business owners are busy, so a quick, weekly recap email might make sense.\n\nYou can register to the service to link your Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts. There would be also be a simple login system so you can see the data as it's been gathered that week.\n\nIn the report you can also quickly view the top post (for example, of all the check-ins in Instagram you get that week, we show the one with most likes).

This is where the Joint Art Endeavor comes in. A website where visionaries can post their ideas in detail and contract artists who are willing to carry out the ideas. E.g. you have a vision for an animated short film, but don't have the resources or abilities to create the end product yourself. Post the direction you want, and talented artists will work for a fee. Furthermore, should the artists and commissioners decide to sell their work, the profits are split between them.\n\n Furthermore, what if this were to extend beyond just art (drawing, painting, sculpting, animation)? The website could be used to contract any number of talented craftsman so long as they could upload samples of their work to the internet. Architects, furniture makers, etc. If someone likes a certain artist's work, they could commission that artist to make something for them. The website would probably need to have a social networking framework in order to put people in contact with each other. Looking for interested parties who could help design the website and plan logistics.	2019-09-10 16:59:56.552768

736	/startup-idea/medassist	Consider a locality which is a bubbling locality for newcomers to the city. What do you do if you fall sick or need to consult a doctor in case of an emergency?\nMedAssist can be a webapplication or mobile application which would consist of a database of doctors and medical centres near the place where you currently are. These doctors can be filtered on the basis of what ailment you want to consult a doctor for. Once you have a list of doctors you can select any one of them on the basis of user reviews and ratings. Also, there could be a feature to fix an appointment with the doctor beforehand so that you do not have to wait in the queue.\n\nHow feasible is the idea guys? Anyone interested to work on it is welcome :)	2019-09-10 16:59:57.563835

740	/startup-idea/any-sports-league-fantasy-game-portal	I would like to provide easy to use platform for having and organising fantasy-league online games for any sport, group, team, company. \n\nSport Fantasy games are games where player builds his/her own team from the professional players of football, hockey, baseball team...and each week after playing part of the league players score is based on real successes of the professional players. For shooting goal you get 3 points, for assistance you get 1 point, for penalty you get -2 points and so on. All ratings will be based on predefined "points table".\n\nImagine the level of the fan having gathering points for your school team or your regional league. :-)\n\nWhy I want to make it:\nThere are some games available already but only for mainstream sports in each country. In my case Czech republic, there is Ice Hockey and soccer Sport Fantasy already available. BUT NOT for basketball, florball, ball hockey and other not so mainstream sports and leagues (Prague Hanspaulka football league etc.)	2019-09-10 16:59:57.563835
741	/startup-idea/rent-a-chef	Have you ever felt too lazy to cook, maybe you have a hot date at home, what if you are having guests over and want to impress.  What Rent-A-Chef sets out to do is allow you to book a top quality chef to come out to your home  at a given time and cook you a feast fit for a king(or queen).  How it works is you select a chef from the site(M or F) and a time and how many people(extra per person), once you have seen the fabulous meals which are available to you at excellent prices, we check to see if this chef is available in your area(certain areas have certain chefs, which means this idea can become international).  Once you have went over the terms and conditions we send you a confirmation email to let you know that this chef is available otherwise we sugggest to you another chef from the site along with a link to his credentials and profile. Once the chef arrives at the alloted time and place, he cooks the meal(s) and everyone is satisfied!!  Tipping is complementary when the chef is leaving\n\nA few things that will need some brainstorming are chef recruitment, how the cleanup will work, etc.. but all in all it seems like a fairly sturdy idea.	2019-09-10 16:59:57.563835
742	/startup-idea/more-than-book-funding	It would be nice to have an online plattform for authors where they can publish parts of their work and let them review by the community. Any logged in user can "like" the authors work and comment if the author have activated this function. \nBehind the plattform is one or more publisher who can get in contact with the author if he has enough likes. They will work togehter to publish the book. \nWhich means for the publisher he knows about the demands of the consumer before printing it. \nNot only these both parties gain advantage from that plattform. Members of the plattform, just normal consumers, as well can profit from. For example by bargein price or advanced publications. \nWhat do you think about that idea?	2019-09-10 16:59:57.563835

743	/startup-idea/world-tours-with-a-difference	Remember those hop-on hop-off buses? How about those on a larger scale? If there is a country/continent where tourists want to explore at a cheap rate, there could be a lot of those buses that drive around the cities. Tourists can get of at stations and then take another bus to explore another part of the country/city. And these buses can be spread across cities and boundaries. It'll attract tourists because it will be as cheap as the public transport system for them. It would also help development because of the tourism growth.	2019-09-10 16:59:57.563835
744	/startup-idea/virtual-deck-of-cards	I would like to develop an app for mobile phones, tablets, etc... That would essentially be a deck of playing cards. The app would replace a traditional deck of playing cards. Anyone with the app can interact with whomever invites them to their card game.  It would be similar to an online casino but you would only be able to play with people in the room. Let's say there are 7 kids sitting around in the playroom after thanksgiving dinner and they decide they want to play crazy 8s, go fish, poker or some other card game......however, there isn't a deck to be found at Grandma's house. These kids simply download our virtual deck app onto each of their devices and they can all play with their phone or tablet in their hand as if they were holding a "hand" of cards. I would be interested in teaming up with developers and investors to bring this app to market.	2019-09-10 16:59:58.651459

A hybrid of quora and linkedin where users can describe the activity they do mostly through out the day and ask others about the ways their skill can be of use to others.\n Ex: A guy who wastes most of the time on facebook can be of use to the guy who make apps as he can ask his friends to become early adopter. Guy who does nothing but spending time with girlfriend can give suggestion on how to approach a girl to geeks.\n	2019-09-10 16:59:58.651459
746	/startup-idea/outfit	Buying clothes online it's cheap, but always a risk (wrong size, strange folds, etc). What if an app can create a 3D model of your body, letting you have a look at your outfit before to pay, saving bad surprises? You can just download a model of the very nice shirt and the cool trousers you are looking at into the app and you will be able to check how cool you are, share it on your social media and see if your friends like it.

751	/startup-idea/improving-noncompliance	Patient will need to register an account and it will be linked to the specific pharmacy where the patient buys any medication. The pharmacist can then insert the information including the name of the medication, time recommended to take the medication, frequency of taking the medication, duration of taking the medication. Those information will then be encrypted and stored over the cloud and synchronised with the patient’s account where those informations will be shown. On the patient’s smartphone, the information will automatically be interpreted and reminder to take the relevant medication will be set. When the time to take the medication is up, alarm of the phone will ring and an interface will show up and patient will be asked to select medication taken or not taken. The pharmacist will also have access to the data on compliance of the patient. In the app, the patient will also have the option to report any side effects encountered while taking the medication and rate it as urgent, major discomfort or minor discomfort. These data will be visible to the pharmacist so that any necessary amendment can be made. \n	2019-09-10 16:59:58.651459

756	/startup-idea/face-to-face-e-commerce-site	The problem with e-commerce as it stands is a lack of communication between the seller and the customer. There is no customer service and experience outside of buying something for the lowest price possible. This is why traditional brick-and-mortar retail stores are still king for high-end purchases.\n\nMy solution is to build an e-commerce site where you can have a direct face-to-face conversation with the seller, making the customer experience a lot more personal and enjoyable whilst potentially increasing sales for high-end merchants. Merchants get a percent commission per extra item that they sell on top of the items in the cart.\n\nWe would start with branded clothing lines and jewellery, since these are prime industries where customer service is of paramount importance, but then we could shift to other high value areas like furniture and potentially even real estate.	2019-09-10 16:59:58.651459

767	/startup-idea/blood-discovery-apparatus--boa-	This is more of a hit, if the engineer fragment of the idea comes together. This is more of a product for a fast telling of someone's blood type. I know, there is already a way to find your blood type. But not in the way it is efficient and fast for Doctors and Nurses. When a patient comes in with, let's say, a gun shot wound; the first thing or one of the first things to do is stabilize and give a blood transfusion. \n\nHopefully, haven't lost you yet.\n\nThe nurse doesn't know the patient's blood type so the first thing they do is give 0 negative.. As blood type has to be compatible with each other. After the initial transfusion of O negative, then someone is sent to run tests to find blood type. There is a blood shortage. And the B.O.A would be an answer to a few issues. The B.O.A is a small handheld machinery, that i'd like to be as small as a common day cellphone. Where as a simple prick of a finger, or where ever will yield results where a nurse can get the patient's blood matched correctly and efficiently. Blood has different price points that hospitals much abide by. B.O.A is cost effective, as price point vary by type. And less work for the nurses to find the blood type.\n\n	2019-09-10 16:59:59.522316

If not, then can anyone suggest what's the main pain point for the startup founder and if it is yes, then don't you think that the startup founders will look for validating their startup idea and there must a good idea validation company who will serve such purposes. In short, I want to know if there is a demand for such company who can validate ideas of startup founders based on secondary research or based on some kind of algorithm built into their system where idea are validated on different parameters.

Powerpoint and Keynote can't create a neat video while Adobe After Effect is way too expensive, even with student discount. So if anyone can make this happen, I'll def. pay!

781	/startup-idea/take-away-ordering-method	When you order something from a take away shop you expect it to be made quickly, it never is. How about an app that lets you place your order before you get to the store, that tells you an estimate of how long it will be and sends you a message when it's ready.

785	/startup-idea/organising-events-with-friends	The hardest part of organising a catchup with friends or acquaintances is finding the best day/night that everyone is free. I think we've all experienced the pain of countless back and forth emails until a time is found or everyone gives up.\n\nFacebook has their events option but what about createing a calendar as well so your friends can select what day and time is best for them. This way you can instantly see what the best option would be. \n\nYou could also then have a suggestion section of what is available to do in the area. Ie, restaurant, movies, etc.\n\nPayments options can be included  if an event needs to be paid for before it occurs.\n\nMany options possible but this would be the basic idea.	2019-09-10 17:00:00.374439

788	/startup-idea/managed-wordpress-hosting	The idea is Wordpress.com-on-steroid. Basically get all self-hosted Wordpress advantage but still user don't have to mess with server or hosting configuration. Target market is Wordpress first time and beginner user(think of this as user choose us instead of shared hosting to use self-hosted Wordpress).\n\nExisting service is WPEngine, Zippykid and Page.ly but then again they focus on mature user and starting price is steep. We can offer $10/month and give user better than shared hosting experience by optimizing our server to use Wordpress.\n\nRevenue :\n$Monthly subscription\n$Custom domain setup fee\n\nThere approximately 2 millions of new Wordpress user each year and this really is huge market currently monopolized by shared hosting company and reseller.\n\nI need cofounder to market this who is also experienced as Wordpress webmaster, and angel investor to kickstart this idea.	2019-09-10 17:00:02.247815
789	/startup-idea/task-lottery	Basically a lottery for which you have to be the first fulfill a task. For everybody who registered (for a small fee), at a specific time a question gets send. The more people register, the higher the reward the winner gets, plus sponsoring, and the more difficult the question. It could be for example: Whats the name of the dog of the guy who makes the only lemonade with raspberry taste in town? The guy knows about it, shuts off his phone, goes to the office and waits for the first person to arrive and ask him. In this case it has to be limited to a city to ensure equal chances, but other versions are possible: Investigative questions (who bought and cut down the city forest), funny ones (find an albino duck), etc... The motivation for the player is to have an interesting day actually doing something new and even maybe getting a reward for it. The sponsor gets known and the lottery company a share.  \n(I think it would work, as the website who asks you questions for money worked: http://www.needaproblem.com/en/.)	2019-09-10 17:00:02.247815

791	/startup-idea/teach-children-and-small-kids-programming	Chess is interesting problem to solve, but most of the effort that is used to learn it and even to become a Grand Master is wasted on something that has no real world application. All good players all the way up to Grand Masters and World champions use hardwired to pattern matching chess, so all of their abilities are virtually useless for anything else.  All the skills that could be reused somewhere else could be learned in chess in a month.\n\nNow, imagine a 2 year old kid that you inspired to program rather than play musical instrument or chess and then cultivated his interest in programming that he practice most days because he loves doing it like some prodigy kids love playing music or chess. And then imagine what he could accomplish by the time he is 18 years old. \n\nHe may even be able to single-handedly rewrite entire source-code of Facebook from scratch in a few month.\n\nSo I want to develop an educational program for 2 year olds and up to teach them programming.	2019-09-10 17:00:02.247815

793	/startup-idea/mobile-contact-transfer	Feeling lucky that I am living in an era of mobile phones evolution. More and more people are upgrading to smartphones from basic phones. It becomes part of their (and mine as well) life. Thanks to the current economy system which allows user to buy smartphones like grocery. But transferring contacts from old phone to new phone is big challenge. SIM card has limitation of transferring around 200 single no. entry. Desktop app has limitation of different operating system of old and new phone. So here is an opportunity to serve the world with mobile app which makes contact transferring easy from different OS. Currently there are hardly any app available which can help transfer contacts for all OS. So I feel opportunity is huge as market is so big and virgin.\n\n?I wanted to make a mobile app which help user to “switch” his/her Phone book contacts from one mobile platform to another platform seamlessly.\n?I want to name this app as Switch\n?Features:\n?

795	/startup-idea/meetup-for-learning-some-skill-with-others	We all know that online education is great. However, it can get a bit lonely and motivation wanes. How about a site that gets people to meetup with other people within the same skill level to learn and motivate each other. You join a local group by city and you state the level of skill and the topic you want to learn. Example, I want to learn Python, I am a beginner. It can have other information about the topic and skills levels of each participate. Therefore they don't feel like a burden to other people that are more skilled. And a more skilled person can also join the group if they want to help out. I know there are sites out there that do Meetups and Workshops. But they don't do it based on the level of skill of the participant. It can be for any skill. Some skills that there are no classes for as well.

815	/startup-idea/clean-living	India suffers from a lot of unclean public places. If we carefully observe, much of this is domestic waste that's unprocessed. There isn't a good system that collects waste from each house and process it. All people from a colony dump all their waste in 1 or 2 dust bins which will not be picked up daily and not processed properly. If properly processed this domestic waste can be turned into a good fertilizer and plastic and metal can be recycled.\n\nSo I think it will be great if we can create a company which can  take care of this problem. \n\nThe key is doing this professionally. Not like the government.\n1.Our workers should collect the waste daily or once in two days.\n2.Workers should be trained properly about waste handling and communication with people\n3.Workers must be trained to educate people about separating their waste into food, plastic, metal.\n4.There should be a waste processing plant. We should be able to handle atleast 100 houses waste as a start.\n5.Also the place around customer house also must be kept clean. This includes cleaning in front of the house, removing any waste materials in front of the house, Clearing the drains in front of the house.\n	2019-09-10 17:00:19.41726

But when you buy something you pay maybe 75 or 50 percent to send one of that same product to someone who needs it (i.e. Third world country, homeless shelter). The app could be an online version of the market itself like Amazon but it would also tell you where the nearest GiveMarket is if youd rather physically go.

825	/startup-idea/ideaswatchcom-enhancement	ideaswatch.com enhancement. \n\nWhy:\nAs a general rule, don’t be afraid to share your ideas. Ideas are cheap, and not everyone has the ability to execute on them. Furthermore, even if you do manage to keep your idea a secret until launch, word will eventually get out and competition will come up anyway. It’s better to bounce your ideas off of other people to solidify your plan.\nGreat ideas are abundant, but it's what you decide to do with them that counts.\n\nSolution:\nWe focus on one thing only, you post your idea, let the crowd be the judge. This way, you will see your idea from all sort of view instead of just by you. \n\nOffer bullet system, reward system. More detail will be posted on the comment section (if approved).	2019-09-10 17:00:19.41726

The user would be positioned by GPS and the app would show the local taxi numbers that the user could just call. In order to reduce language barriers, in some places the user may instead send an SMS to the taxi company with the current address and ask for a car in the local language, with the SMS template also crowdsourced the same way.<br><br>For Uber, the application would instead send an SMS to a predefined number, also with the current GPS position and address. There would be a web service that receives and  handles those SMS messages, where the user's Uber profile would have to be defined, and it would somehow intermediate an Uber call for that user.	2019-09-10 17:00:31.098909

841	/startup-idea/trades-people-app	I find it that getting a trades person to come and quote a job around the house is usually a big process. Imagine if you had an app that could simplify that process. \n\nFor an example if you needed a painter and within the app you could take a photo of your house and what needs to be painted with some basic questions and this information would be sent directly to the trades person. The trades person could review and quite in a very short time the price could be eg: between $3000-3500. Once the user gets this information back and they know roughly what the cost is they could then request a formal quote from the tradesmen. This would eliminate time wasting for both the person wanting the quote and the tradesman. I belive this could work for any trades job.

843	/startup-idea/procastination	Very simple idea but I think very effective in terms of following up on things you say you are going to do and never do. Every time you say you will do something at a later time or date, your phone adds that task as a reminder to your calendar no matter what. If it is confused it will ask the user to input what the task is but it will added to your calendar regardless.<br>For example, you tell your wife you will pick up milk tomorrow after work. The app looks at the word tomorrow, automatically takes you to your calendar and you are forced to add the time and task. <br>The user would have to be agree  to be bugged by this app but it will definitely come in handy to get things done, especially for procrastinators.	2019-09-10 17:00:36.945236

Picture this: within a year of the development of this website there could be potentially 1 million users, 2% of fantasy players, paying $5 a month for the service. That totals up to $60,000,000 at the end of the year.

I know there are several services offering help with your online presence, but what about a search engine that shows you all the pictures, text (blogs etc) and data in servers (used for advertisements) on you online. Ideally, the next step is to give the user control over this information, either by addressing the owner or posting improved pictures/information (post new things and SEO those, the old ones will be harder to find). Although it’s hard or almost impossible to remove information about you that others hold, the growing amount of privacy laws (especially in Europe) could be useful as well.

869	/startup-idea/eco-friendly-usage-of-receipts-from-atms	When we withdraw cash from teller machines we ask for receipts which basically finds a place in the nearest waste basket.Consumer and retail outlets can align with the banks to provide discount coupons to people who withdraw cash.This discount coupon gets printed on the back side of the receipts we get from the ATM's.Retail outlets can even offer unique codes to these receipts.There could be a lucky draw if the consumer en cashes these coupons then he enters a lucky draw.This would ensure that receipts get collects at stores.Once collected at a common place these can be again recycled.Yes..after the receipts are printed the customer details should get cleared or get garbled after few hours to ensure privacy.	2019-09-10 17:00:45.662115
870	/startup-idea/e-commerce-service-comparison	Today there are several e-commerce websites selling a lot of products. I plan to make a simple application where customers rate these websites on 5 parameters. This will add up to the score ranking the service. (This is like +1 by Google)	2019-09-10 17:00:47.573551
871	/startup-idea/service-for-split-testing-db-values	I have not find such service yet. Main focus here is that you can split test DB's records with no effort,development,...\nSplit testing of values from DB is important as there are stored important values like prices,discounts .... . I think it can be a web service.Customers can integrate it with using the API and split test desired records with multiple values and understand whats going on.It will also has admin page where you can define desired variations of a record and also will have tracking and nice charts for viewing them.	2019-09-10 17:00:47.573551
872	/startup-idea/show-off-argumentative-brainless-bloggers	Is there no blog that you really, really hate?  The author(s) is/are brilliant.  Their treatment of commenters, their way of writing - it makes you want to punch your monitor, though.  Why don't we showcase the most exemplary idiots of the blogosphere in a site where members can:\n1. Nominate a "blob," or blogging buffoon for the prestigious "Blow-hard of the Blogosphere award";\n2. Submit their own blog for members to (voluntarily - and to score points in our system which acknowledges the "Blog Border Patrol," or perhaps, the "CMS Stasi") critique, since we improve our blogs when we learn what people hate about them;\n3. Share screenshots of infamous "blogholes" on our Facebook community page wall."\n\nSKYPE osakasaul if interested, and especially if you know Joomla or .css or have php, MYSQL and oAuth development (backend) experience - and preferably, at least "survival-level" English ability and some experience blogging."\n\nIf this project is not for you, but you think I'm as cool as I think of myself, why not say hi in SKYPE anyway; maybe we can team up on another - "less evil" - project?  I have them too, and I'll bet you do as well.	2019-09-10 17:00:47.573551
873	/startup-idea/humanity-science-representation	Would you like to see graphs and trees showing the advancement of the world knowledge of Sciences ? To be able to browse general sciences by categories, see fancy animations when zooming in sub-categories of sciences, and see the current scientists working on awesome projects at the edge of our knowledge, updated in real time ?\n\nSo much could be done: Analysis of the current science fields (we could discover very crowdy fields, where lot of scientists are working on similar project and should better work together instead), Analysis of the speed of progression for the Humanity knowledge (open doors to very accurate predictions for the future), and so much more ! \n\nThe goal would be to implement a platform with restful apis, and attract the research centers and other individual researchers to join the movement, and let us scrape public informations in order to build relevant and up-to-date graphs.	2019-09-10 17:00:47.573551

The number of old, irrelevant messages once archived but now completely useless clutter search results, returning hundreds of emails on each query.\n\nSolution: analyse the Gmail Archive folder based on sender, keywords, email length etc. The Ganitor then suggests email criteria for review, which are then mass deleted	2019-09-10 17:00:47.573551
875	/startup-idea/language-exchange	The best and easiest way to learn a language would be to talk and communicate with another individual! \nIf there was a website that would link individuals with a shared primary language such as english and a different secondary language that both speak relatively fluent. Then , think it would be a great opportunity for both individuals to meet someone that is perhaps from a different place and learn some pronounciations and words to communicate with in the future. People wanting to learn or improve a new language could sign up and friend the person which you would like to chat again sometime!	2019-09-10 17:00:47.573551

I am considering also designing some special program to be realized on cruises. However, contrary to traditional approach to this business,  (diets and exercise),  I would like to offer most of all a psychological perspective and put a focus on the problems underlying the eating issues. I think it's quite an innovative project and I would love to hear your opinion and ideally, to find sb to cooperate.\n	2019-09-10 17:00:47.573551
879	/startup-idea/improving-the-khan-academy	I think the Khan Academy is probably the next big thing in education. It will fundamentally and dynamically aid the way we learn. Yet, some will state that even though it will be a huge leap forward, the presence of a teacher is still indisposable. Well, lets develop an interactive hologram to go with the Khan Academy.  Holograms are availble in its basic form (Tupac Hologram performance) but its quite possible to bring to an enhanced level with funding and guidance. This development wouldn;t stop at education; it could be a buddy  to talk to, exercise with, etc. Once the tech is perfected, I would even conduct a study to see if it helped alleviate depression.	2019-09-10 17:00:47.573551
880	/startup-idea/video-game-preorders-based-on-time-discount	I'm thinking of this model of selling video games.\n\nMany sellers offer oportunity to buy a game before the release date. But I would like to focus only on those preorders, because I think, that customers, that preordered the product deserve something more. I mean "time discount". The price of the video games would increase each day by little amount till the standard/normal price on release day. \n\nLogic is very simple: The sooner you buy, the less you pay.	2019-09-10 17:00:47.573551
881	/startup-idea/adventurecoin	It's always interesting to hear the backstory on items you find in antique shops or geocaching. The geocoin concept is especially interesting, as coins are moved from cache to cache by players. \n\nAdventureCoin is a similar gaming concept, with geocoins being distributed to players, who then take the coin on some adventure before passing it along to another adventurer. A website would keep track of who has had the coin and the adventures on which the coin has been taken, including stories and photos. For instance, a coin may have been taken by one player on a skydiving adventure, another player may have taken the coin on a military tour of Iraq. Maybe another coin accompanied an adventurer who climbed Mt. Everest or an actor who made a movie while carrying the coin.\n\nGamification could be used to encourage players to use and pass on the coins.\n\nA possible business model could be a membership fee, or advertising revenues (if a company wanted to sponsor a special AdventureCoin).\n\nAdventureCoin\nBe a part of the experience.	2019-09-10 17:00:47.573551

887	/startup-idea/unified-platform-for-electronic-bills	Everyone has utility services (gas, water, electricity, etc) and most companies provide their own site for their clients to access their bills. This is very frustrating since you have to keep track of different accounts, different sites and different UX. Then, there's no simple way for people to visualize their total expenditure, history, etc.\nMy idea is to develop a unified, open source platform which companies can use in three ways: by their own (it's open source), as a cloud service (SaaS) or using our running platform on which users receive their bills automatically.	2019-09-10 17:00:49.900619

889	/startup-idea/legislation-tracker-analyzer	Every year tens of thousands of new pieces of legislation are proposed, thousands of which are passed into law. These laws can affect businesses in many ways, but there is no easy way for businesses to find and track legislation that will directly affect them. <br><br>I suggest using OpenStates.org's free API to gather data about legislation in different states and then build statistical or machine-learning based models that can predict the likelihood that new pieces of legislation will pass. Legislative tracking is already a hundred million dollar industry, but there is no company yet doing predictive analysis at the state level. Business consulting firms would be a huge target demographic for this business.	2019-09-10 17:00:49.900619
900	/startup-idea/perfect-smartphone-selector	Picking a smartphone that is just right for you has become a cumbersome task due to the wide array of products available on the market today.Most of the time consumers tend to buy products based on reviews on websites or recommendations from friends. Due to this, the specific needs and expectations of the buyer are compromised. I want to create an application where a user can enter his specific requirements as well as answer a small psychometric test which will throw up the top three ideal smartphones to buy along with compatibility rating(on a scale from 0-100%). This idea can extended to other consumer products as well like TV, vehicles, apartments etc.	2019-09-10 17:00:53.893626

890	/startup-idea/multi-purpose-credit-card	Receiving gift cards is great, but if you get a lot of them they really clutter your wallet and before you know it you have way too many cards that really just get in the way. \n\nThere are already apps which sort out which cards you have and the balances on each one. However, I was thinking of an actual card that you could use. \n\nThis would be different from loading money on a card; if you received a gift card for $50 to a clothing store and a $15 gift card to  you could transfer the credit from both cards onto your multi-purpose card. When you check out, you could swipe your card and money wouldn't be taken out of your pocket, but rather out of the credit you loaded. \n\nA website and (hopefully a smartphone app in the future) would be needed in order to keep track of the different lines of credit. I"m envisioning something like this: you create an account, then use the website any time you want to load credit from a given store (you would need to include the PIN number for the card as well as the name of the store). The website could send e-mail alerts whenever your credit is getting low. \n\nLooking for programmers who could help me with a website; happy to give more details.	2019-09-10 17:00:49.900619
891	/startup-idea/famijoy---joyful-family-routine---business-idea	One of the most common complaints from families is of paper clutter. It can be in your kitchen or home office, but the piles of paper that stack up get messy and annoying. \n\nA family-oriented, real-life-simulating web/mobile app functionally centred around a cabinet and a calendar, but psychologically hovering around Joy and Cheerfulness. \n\nFamijoy provides an easy-to-use online system to eliminate the very common problems of paper and digital clutter.	2019-09-10 17:00:49.900619
892	/startup-idea/shopizzy	An online shopping site that you only pay when you have received your goods. \n\nTarget market Africa as people are afraid of  online fraud don't know how to track their goods online and some do not have credit cards but are interested in buying online. \n\nThe website will offer a search feature which can find the product from trusted sellers at the lowest price then we do the buying and delivery to the customers door.We will also offer discounts if there are many customers intersted in the same product. \n\nOur revenue will come from charging a small fee for our services and advertising.	2019-09-10 17:00:49.900619
893	/startup-idea/app-for-art--or-cultural-awareness	The only app I have relating to art shows pictures but nothing else while the only apps I can find about anything relating to cultural awareness really only shows information about geography and the analytics of nations, but nothing about their cultural traditions or anything else of the sort.  \n\nWhat would be nice would be an app that could allow something like a mobile wiki for artistic or cultural awareness (likely separately) that could give people who want some easy-to-access information about art or cultural traditions of different places.  \n\nI think it would be good to create three versions: one for kids, one for average people, and one for experts.  And maybe, just maybe, this could an effective combination of technology, art, and education!	2019-09-10 17:00:49.900619

895	/startup-idea/expat-connector	I am thinking to create a mobile app, the idea is simple from my experience of living in Dubai and working there for couple years I got frustrated not knowing any British ppl around. Had to go on forums and meet people through events. So my idea is why not create a mobile app that allows you to select your nationality depending on your locations and arrange to meet up.	2019-09-10 17:00:49.900619
896	/startup-idea/book-of-life	A Graphical Representation of one's life. An online tool where you login and update your daily routine. Your base routine would be fixed and on top of that he/she would add special daily notes, not as a blog but events - like attended this party, today was a sad day, today I was extremely thrilled, hectic work today etc - all of these short notes accompanied by a emotion selector of kinds - some suggestive graphical icons or so. All in all, a simple UI where you can record your daily life - and it gives you a plot (a unique one) - of your life as it goes on using that data in the back-end. It can also give suggestions based on some intelligent algorithm as in - you must take a holiday, stop partying a lot, or work is taking priority over family, or just give the user a representation of the highs and lows in life. Basically a life book one can cherish and add to forever! What say?	2019-09-10 17:00:49.900619
897	/startup-idea/turn-restaurant-receipts-into-experience-snapshots	If you're a foodie and eat at a lot of restaurants, chances are that you may remember your experiences, but may not always remember what you've ordered. I'm proposing an app that automatically converts your restaurant receipts into an editable dashboard containing the restaurant profile info, items you ordered, and offering options to rate or like/dislike dishes, review dishes, auto populate dish photos (if you've taken any), share with friends, and store for your own record. This record will serve as your experience snapshot and you can reference it any time you want. If I'm able to build a participating network, restaurants can even offer reward points for these experience snapshots. Depending on how many of these snapshots are public, the app can become a type of dish-review engine as well.	2019-09-10 17:00:49.900619

The budget will be used until it is finished, and only one person per day- either chosen by the payer or random chosen by the application may receive the money gift. Once the user which is payed has reached a certain amount - the money are released by the site's admins in his/her bank account/ paypal account	2019-09-10 17:00:53.893626
899	/startup-idea/click-share-market	My idea is for a photo application, but specific for marketing and advertising purpose. The app should have a selection of templates, or option to upload template. The template should have an option to upload a logo and caption etc. Eg. Pizza Hut logo. A date stamp and a place to update occasion and location. Should also have option to tag people from Facebook and G+. The idea is that customers at a restaurant for example can have their photo taken by one of the staff members using a smartphone or tab. The photo will have the template of the restaurant with the logo added automatically. This can now be simultaneously be uploaded to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google plus in one click. Once the customers are tagged in the photos, their photo will appear in the timeline of all their friends including the timeline of the Restaurant Facebook page. This will be an indirect marketing technique where the restaurant will get presence in all friends circle. The more the tags, the more the exposure.	2019-09-10 17:00:53.893626

There should be an app that focuses on planning, but lets you share and invite people to the plans you make. It would also help you check up on each other about tasks that need to be done, generate ideas for the future, and prioritize.

909	/startup-idea/handmade-product-picker	I love shopping on Etsy, but my favorite shops on there are all relatively small and independent. This means they often will run out of products for sale altogether and will just show up blank in my favorite shops list...which is lame.\n\nIt would be really cool if there was an app that was smart enough to only display shops that actually had products currently for sale and which could comb the millions of other shops on Etsy and suggest items based on my past purchases and the products I have added to my favorites. \n\nIt would be extra cool if you could setup profiles for family and friends which you buy gifts for on Etsy.

915	/startup-idea/chain-of-motor-cycle-driving-schools	I think this will be very useful in a country like India. Just think about it. There are a lot of driving schools available to learn car driving but I don't find any school that teaches motor cycle riding in a safe and secure environment. People have to beg friends to learn and the learning is not in a safe environment.\n\nThis could be very useful.

918	/startup-idea/avoid-accidents	As we know in India almost 50% of accidents are because of overtaking, so it would be better if we can avoid it.

920	/startup-idea/pictext	Many keyboards available in the mobile platform have handwriting recognition tool which converts the handwriting of the user into texts. When we have such accurate pattern recognition techniques, we should also have a tool to which can convert handwriting in images to editable text. I found some online OCR websites which claimed to do exactly this, but believe me NONE OF THEM WORKED. I tried to convert multiple images having clear handwriting but none of them gave me the exact text which otherwise my google handwriting keyboard could easily do it.\nSeveral image processing techniques can be made use of in order to recognize patterns.  So my idea is, why not integrate some good pattern recognition techniques from images so that immediately after a pic is taken, the text document is ready for editing.	2019-09-10 17:00:56.488019

923	/startup-idea/bring-the-demand-to-supply---airlines	Problem - For an airline, estimating the last minute seat sale is the most tedious task and is currently being done with the help of advanced revenue management software. Based on the sale curve, the airline releases the higher buckets as the time to fly nears. The problem lies when the price is not suitable for sale and they end up losing revenue and flying empty seats.\nSolution - Develop a demand aggregator, its an app and website where people can go and provide their prospective dates of travel and the price range that they are ready for pay for that flight, the data will be constantly fed to the airline to provide them a more concise demand. The expected fare that the person would like to pay, will be paid at the time of logging in his demand, if the demand is acceptable to the airline the airline would release the seat to him and if not the money will be returned back to the person.	2019-09-10 17:00:56.488019

949	/startup-idea/dealmaker%24-tinder-meets-amazon	My idea is basically an app where you make a buyer and/or seller profile and select what you're interested in buying/selling (with various filters like year, color, condition, type, distance, preferred payment method, preferred delivery method, etc. - in this example, i'll use old coins as the product since I'm into that kinda thing). Then say i'm a buyer who's interested in 2 and 3 cent coins from the 1860's. I would be "matched" daily with sellers who are interested in selling said coins (same like/dislike mechanics as tinder). Sellers will also be matched with buyers who are interested in their products, and be able to view their profiles and ratings from previous transactions. Matches with the ability to be sorted by most recent, high/low price, rating, nearest to me, etc would also make it useful to the users. Also allowing buyers or sellers to search for specific items or users will allow more freedom than tinder. I believe this app could be very successful and could easily be made free on the app store. Constructive criticism is definitely needed though because this is not a complete idea by any means, just something i thought should be a thing.	2019-09-10 17:00:59.173766

960	/startup-idea/match-stem-majors-with-projects-to-help-out-now	Companies, especially in manufacturing, are always underutilizing their people to do archaic and absolutely wasteful processes. Half of the labor force in most are from the Baby Boomer generation. In other words about a third are making "the real decisions" on a golf course while 2/3's are trying figure out how to gain access to data and resources on their own. Unfortunately, what the 1/3 was not paying attention to was the the fact that now their multi-million dollar deal that was taken care of during one round of golf has just turned into a multi-billion dollar opportunity that can begin providing action within minutes if not seconds. Business leaders are picking up quickly though. They're wondering why employees like me are looking into this tool called crowdsourcing. Well, its probably because like most other employees my age, we're tired of not having the basic tools we need to do our jobs as quickly as we know it can be done...now imagine all manufacturing type businesses being majorly impacted by this same issue. Are we truly  in need of a 3rd industrial revolution? They once were the bloodstream of this country...maybe its time crowdsourcing became its heartbeat.	2019-09-10 17:01:01.942202

And it is possible to search through that accumulated stuff. Therefore manufacturers, producers, providers can easily learn what there's a demand for. Moreover, they can send out ads that will only be delivered to those users who have previously declared appropriate interests.

966	/startup-idea/supcomputer-accessibility	A MIT professor was able to build a supercomputer  using 8 playstations and OS software. The total cost is $2600.  It costs $5,000 to use a supercomputer once. With that in  mind and knowing that the key to US economic growth depends firmly on knowledge, wouldn't this be a great idea to market this as a prime business opportunity? I mean big players like IBM are trying to make this a reality in the future by making their expensive supercomputers available to small and medium enterprises.  By being able to bring down costs considerably using 8 playstations, we could bring down costs considerably to use and still make profit.  But instead of focusing only on small and medium business, get college students and professionals involved (young/old ppl have great ideas that are never tested in the real world for a variety of reasons). So, build  a supercomputer using this prof.'s expertise, develop the software around it and center it initially in 6 state universities strategically located across the country. The reason I chose state universities is that usually they have more than one campus, security and they accomodate a huge number of students. Take SUNY/CUNY for example (word limit).	2019-09-10 17:01:01.942202
967	/startup-idea/final-message-online-personal-will	At some point, I believe you realized that death is inevitable but many people don't realize or don't bother to leave a will or just one final message to their loved one.\n\nHow it works?\nUser can register using FB/Twitter/OpenID and start writing their will right away. They will set time interval and name 2 recipient of their will(email). Time interval function as reminder where we send weekly/monthly/yearly reminder to user email and user need to click to reset the timer. If user was gone from this world, there will be no response and this timer will stop and the will that have been written will be send to the 2 recipient.\n\nThis is more of a community effort and not profit based idea. Still we need to sustain the service and I propose advertisement in form of affiliate link to related service such as legal will writer, insurance etc.\n\nI need help from anyone who interested in giving back to community, publicity, developer to help me with the system(preferably Python/Node.js/RoR). \n\nDisclaimer : This is not in any way try to provide legal will service.\n	2019-09-10 17:01:01.942202
968	/startup-idea/community-platform-for-heath-clubs	I develop custom social networks and had this idea a while ago when visiting my gym.  Why do none of then have custom social networks?  Everyone has something in common at those places, and when you take a class it would be fun to contact one of the people there.   Every class or activity could have its "group" and the member's profiles could be as complete, or as vague as they wanted - and of course you could control all communication.  This would be a hybrid "online / real life" network that I think would be fun and would add value to the health club membership.	2019-09-10 17:01:04.481061

973	/startup-idea/todo-dashboard-with-widgets-instead-of-todo-lists	Hi everyone.\n\nI want to describe an idea of todo dashboard.  Everyone knows about todo websites like rememberthemilk.com, todoist.com and others. In our opinion,  this approach lacks expressiveness, and it would be great if you could write down something like "Meet Bob at 8pm" and system understands who Bob is and that 8pm is actually 20:00.\n\nThis brings us to the idea of widgets - cards that represent different types of tasks like meetings, deadlines, notes, bookmarks etc. and dashboard on which these widgets can be placed.\n\nDepending on a task type widget has different representations and functionality, but the main point is to show user information about his tasks not in plain text.\n\nWe have created a prototype/alpha version of the application - todombo.com. It is working and you can actually use it to plan your days. \n\nOur current version supports only one type of widgets - simple cards with title and description. Any feedback would help us a lot since we don't understand whether this idea makes sense to other people or not.\n\nThank You.	2019-09-10 17:01:04.481061

I want to create a website that matches websites with space available and companies that would like to advertise. Very often, I see advertisements on websites that don’t make sense (ex. women's clothing on a sports website). We would match both parties based on profiles that they fill out that specifies their desired target markets, campaign budget, desired reach, etc. and match them like a dating site would. This saves time, money, and effort for both sides while increasing effectiveness of marketing for everyone.

Well what if every single phone uploaded their picture to a universal album called let's say "Xscape 2/6/2014". Using either GPS or Wi-Fi, the phone will know what club they are in. So let's say a stranger took a photo of you on their phone, you would then be able to see it as well.

Any bus service, looking to provide real time information to their consumers, can use it.\n\nThe data would come from the GPS systems that are installed in almost all buses that are part of a major city or corporation.

1005	/startup-idea/a-comprehensive-website-for-sport-fans	Teams across the globe tourney across countries. I believe that a comprehensive website which provides details of the various tournaments being played by teams across the globe in a season, while providing a platform for booking of travel and lodging is absent. I want to develop a platform which not only entails these but also provides reviews of nearby restaurant and places to visit. This platform will not only be of a huge help to the fans who would like to travel with their teams but also help in promoting tourism for specific countries. This will involve clubbing of data available from the various travel, tourism and restaurant rating agencies like (Zomato).  I want to start this on a small scale and would then like to develop it to encompass all sports across all the countries. Be it football, cricket, baseball or rugby, there constitutes a giant untapped market of fans cheering for their teams who trot along with them. Capitalizing on this will not only be a very attractive revenue source but will also have a major impact on sports and sports infrastructure.	2019-09-10 17:01:08.885023

1015	/startup-idea/golf-cart-taxi-service-on-college-campus	College campuses are getting larger and larger. Students are often walking through adverse weather for any given period of time when they don't have to!\nFor a small fee (not decided, but an estimate of a penny a second), we would use golf carts to transport students to different areas of campus, directly to the building!\nUtah State University already believe the project feasible, and would allow these carts on their campus for the students to use at their discretion. On any given cart, up to four students could fit. The more carts you have, the more places you can go and the more students you can transport.\nAS for the drivers, I believe a 40-50% commission would suffice since the time for switching between classes only occurs 2-3 times per hour, and an hourly wage wouldn't make sense.\n\nThis business could also offer marketing/advertising for local businesses, and be able to charge a decent amount. It would be seen by hundreds of students a day, and could be a great moneymaker for the company as well. Optional items for students could include blankets, music, etc.\n\nLet me know what you think, and any revisions/thoughts you have, please!	2019-09-10 17:01:10.886726

1025	/startup-idea/dcash	Carrying or possessing cash is always a problem to people. To solve this to some extent, cards and mobile wallets came into existence. What if you are out of charge in your mobile to spend money or forgot your wallet at your home. The other problem also with them is they are vulnerable to hacks or robbery. With us, even the slightest possibility of losing cash will be eradicated.

You will be always possessing the cash with you irrespective of place or situation you're in. Yet there will not be a single chance of losing your money anyway. No need to remember PINs or Passwords. You will not need even internet to spend the cash with merchants.

1026	/startup-idea/easy-pharm	Often we wait in a queue at the pharmacy to purchase medicines prescribed by the doctor. After consultation with the doctor you need to come out with the prescription, reach the nearest pharmacy, wait in the queue and finally purchase the prescribed medicine. The wait time in the queue can be avoided using this app. How? Here it is. The doctor uses this app to select the prescribed medicines for the patient and sends a request to the nearest pharmacy. Simultaneously, a message is sent to the patient/his relative's with the details of the prescription and a token number. Before the patient/his relative reach to the pharmacy the medicines are kept ready at the pharmacy for the respective token number. All he has to do is, collect the medicine for that token number, do the payment and get back. \nAnother advantage of this solution is we need not preserve hand-written prescriptions (which we tend to lose often). One can just scroll through message inbox and find it. How is the idea? I believe this would work in a country like India where one has to wait in long queues at pharmacies.	2019-09-10 17:01:14.072337

We are interested to design one single Mobile app which can have all the hospitals and doctors in your city would be registered and can be taken appointment by the patient or the attendant. the reminder massage can be fixed to remind the time of scheduled visit or cancellation of appointment in case of emergency absence of the doctor.	2019-09-10 17:01:15.43373

1057	/startup-idea/open-source-bank	The investment-side of banking has a single main objective: estimate risks. The profit of an investment is often known, hence if risk is known, the expected financial outcome is also known, and a bank can simply invest in the projects with the highest expected risk-adjusted return. Estimating risk is thus nearly the single reason of existance for banks and other investors alike.\n\nBanks are clearly moving from a qualitative approach (this guy seems trustworthy, let's fund him) to a quantitative approach (of loan-takers with this-and-this data profile, we can demonstrate that only 1% default) in the estimation of their risks, and hence in the allocation of their money. This means that no longer will they use an office building full of suits and ties as risk investigators, but increasingly they will just use data and algorithms to do the job.\n\nIf these algorithms would be open source, everyone could start a bank. That would democratize banking and end the windfall profits which are now common in this sector. It would democratize banking by letting the general population understand and adjust the choices now made by bankers.	2019-09-10 17:01:16.898168

1060	/startup-idea/travel-activity-marketplace--hottest-business-idea	The travel industry is growing at a rapid pace as digital sale of online travel market is 693.91 billion USD. It means starting an online travel business is a profitable idea for aspiring entrepreneur, yes it's true but not completely.

1071	/startup-idea/sausage-do-it-yourself-stand	Once I was walking from the pub with my friends. It was a cold winter and in front of one restaurant there was a bin with burning wood, like to attract the people. We were standing around the bin, warming up the hands and in the same moment few of us said the same sentence: I would have a sausage! What can you do when you live in a city and want to have a nice, DIY made sausage on the club, like when you were a child in a summer camp? Squat someone´s garden? Make a fire on the street? I think that if you take nothing but a bin, make a fire in it, make some wooden clubs, take a guitar, sing some old cowboy songs and offer the peoplein the city or tourist or anyone to grill his sausage, for price of one or two Euro, you will make a happy moment for a lot of people - and for your moneybelt as well:-)	2019-09-10 17:01:18.395292

1075	/startup-idea/best-holiday-pictures	I always come back from holidays with thousands of pictures. I know it's hard to choose the best pictures robotically, but if you are in a hurry it would be great if an app automatically gets rid of low quality pictures (blurred etc.) and remove duplicits (the same temple from 10 slight different angles). Good guess might be enough when you currently don't have time to go through thousands of pictures but you want to have a slideshow somewhere on the background during welcome party.	2019-09-10 17:01:18.395292

The URL stays the same, so wherever you shared your old image, you can see now the new replaced one. \n\nYou could even set the time to change, or to change back and forth\n\nOr you could use an additional tiny image (1x1 pixel and invisible, so it doesn't distract). And when the time is right, you can replace this tiny image with with a new one of your choice.\n\nEven Links can change and redirect to a new site\nThere are some services who can redirect a link and change the destination afterwards like http://tiny.cc.\n\nSo if you combine both, you get a great idea\n\nYou could use it to:\n- advertise\n- Keep others updated\n\nSo what you think about it?	2019-09-10 17:01:20.493812
1089	/startup-idea/bob-ross-pen-after-the-famed-tv-art-teacher	Lots of people could learn to draw if someone spent the time to show them how, and corrected their mistakes as they made them.  That's where the Artist pen comes in.  Similar to some of the pens that record your strokes, this pen has a chip in it. Additionally, it has a tiny accelerometer and a tiny oscillating motor, similar to those that make phones vibrate.  \n\nWhere the Ross Pen differs is that the user uploads, or traces line art, which is then stored in the pen.  Then when the user turns on the "Rossifier" and starts drawing, the pen vibrates to let them know when they are going too far outside the lines.   In this way, everyone can learn the correct ways to shape their figure with gentle nudging in the right directions from their pen.  With a strong enough motor, the pen could also act as a gyroscope and help orient itself to make the correct line.  \n\nWith that, everyone can learn to draw and with practice can tone down the Rossifier and draw on their own.	2019-09-10 17:01:20.493812

However their desktop offerings are rather lacking, resorting to an Adobe Air based cross-platform lowest-common denominator application that delivers not much better user experience than a web browser.\n\nIt would be great if there is a native Cocoa-based OS X client for Yammer that delivers a user experience and level of functionality equivalent to Twitter's official OS X client.\n	2019-09-10 17:01:20.493812
1091	/startup-idea/my-video-life	The idea is to make a live streaming service. Someone shares a live video via mobile phone to a website audience watch it, can communicate with each other and even write\talk to a streamer. So it would look like qik.com or any other - there are plenty of them. But it seems not so popular. The main difference is that it would let you pay the streamer. Just imagine - your friend/stranger streaming as he coming back from a night club and you (online watcher) notice that a nice girl walked through. So you ask him to turn around and get acquainted with her for 5$. Then streamer points that he would even get a her phone number for 15$. Then another online watcher notice your discussion and suggests to pay another 10$ for a streamer. And all watch this show you can be involved in.	2019-09-10 17:01:20.493812

1093	/startup-idea/drive-up-grocery	How many times have you had to stop in between grocery shopping trips at the end of a long day of work, already exhausted, or with the kids in tow, and having to deal with car seats and struggling with the kids through the grocery store, only to repeat it all in reverse to get home. Whew!\n\nMy idea is not your typical drive-up convenience store. Instead, it includes an order station, a la Sonic, but with a scrolling menu board, a pay station, and a limited number of items, simple things that people commonly have to pick up between grocery shopping trips. The order is placed electronically, and then delivered to the car, where the customer checks the order and signs and pays, if they haven't already paid through the station. I can see limiting the number of items to around 20 to keep it simple and easy to deliver to the car.\n\nAlternately, there could be a few full meals available on a rotating basis for families that just want to grab a full meal and go.	2019-09-10 17:01:20.493812

Companies and their products will receive a 1-5 star rating, based on user reviews of their: ethics, transparency, environmental impact, product quality, how they treat their employees and if they are charitable (i.e. partnering/supporting a Non-Profit cause). \n\nThe App will function much like Yelp, but with a focus on positive reinforcement instead of negative criticism. Partner businesses (those who have a high rating and opt for a free partnership) will be allowed to display the App's logo on their website and be listed in the App's Merchant Directory. \n\nThe App will be 100% free, however, users and merchants will be awarded "supporter" status if they make a donation to the App. User/merchant participation, charity, interaction and other actions will be rewarded as well. \n\nWhen a consumer/user scans a UPC, the App will show not only that product's/company's rating/reviews, but it will suggest products/companies with higher ratings/reviews in the same category/industry.\n\n	2019-09-10 17:01:24.520097
1096	/startup-idea/markit	A website where people upload a piece of work then specify what subject it is and what level (e.g. A level, university, post-grad, IB, AP etc.) they also choose several tags or write tags of their own relating to the piece. \n\nThe system then matches this work submission with the most similar one uploaded by someone else in the database - based on the tags, subject and level. The owners of both pieces of work receive the newly matched piece of work which was uploaded by the other person. They cannot download the file or copy and paste text from it but they can make annotations and at the end are asked to write comments, suggestions and give it a rating.\n\nOnce both people have completed this they submit their feedback and the work is once again exchanged so the original uploader of each document gets their own, newly annotated work back. They can then use this to improve their work, as well as perhaps combining that with ideas from the work they just read and gave feedback on.	2019-09-10 17:01:24.520097

You want to have good times with your family on weekends but are too busy researching, planning, and coordinating what to do/where to go on weekend.  \n\nThere are weekend getaway deal sites such as Groupon, Expedia, and Travelzoo.  But they focus on getaways where you travel on a plane, spend nights at a hotel, etc.  What's missing in the market is "daily getaways" where you leave at like 8am and return by 5pm to a place that is within 1-2 hours from where you live.\n\nWhy would people use this service?  One, it's a lightweight, day trip, meaning you don't have to plan weeks ahead, book flights, or pack large bags.  Two, you get to learn about hidden, local getaway gems that are only 1-2 hours away from you.  Three, like other daily deals, the more people sign up, more perks you get.. and I'm talking about things like free transportation or free lunch from businesses/venues where you are visiting.	2019-09-10 17:01:24.520097

Let it be that the customer needs sanitary fix or a small construction to be made or could be he?she wants his vehicle to be serviced. I want a common dial where all can approach there problems in all the localities and we would be the one providing the free home deliveries as well as free home pick services within the permit table area .

Not to mention that your friends get tired of the hassling, and some decisions are a bit more private. Websites like Yahoo Answers can take ages to get lackluster responses or even ridicule.\n\nSolution? A website where people can meet up and talk to people from all different backgrounds and experience levels about a pressing issue in their lives. Guest and Sign-Up accounts available, potential for jobs via 'Experts' and actual professionals, and of course the allure of the ability to ask a stranger if she's DTF, if you're pregnant, if you should get a cat or a dog, and so on.	2019-09-10 17:01:25.89297

1110	/startup-idea/kooleqt---innovative-social-e-commerce-marketplace	We imagine the future of Internet as the Internet and the real world are one in everything. Our world is getting more and more connected and today, people mainly use Internet for information seeking, shopping or go to social networks. \n\nKooleqt is a new concept mixing social networking, a collaborative platform and a huge e-commerce website. It allows users to create, translate, share and interact with Pages. Even more, you can tell the link/relationship you have with a Page (eg: favourite movie, want to go in vacation here, do want this product, ...). Pages can be about a brand, a product/service, a celebrity, a location or an event from the whole world. Users put Pages they like into themed lists they have created and can share these Pages with their friends.\nFor instance, we can have fun by collecting our entire music library, our dressing room, what we like to or not, monuments we visited or places we would like to go... Opportunities are endless. \n\nAn other parculiarity is that each product/service Page that we can find on the Kooleqt website can be sold by anyone, individuals or professionals from anywhere; the platform can be seen as a huge supermarket. \n	2019-09-10 17:01:25.89297

1117	/startup-idea/pin-point-homeless-people	Like I and many others, we have a passion to help homeless people. At one point when I was little, I remember my father offering a homeless man food instead of money because inadequate spending may be one of the causes as to why they are homeless. I came up with an idea that involves a simple, cheap GPS device that can somehow be powered by solar energy or batteries. The homeless person can wear this special device around their neck and/or wrist. They hold the ability to turn it on or off for privacy concerns. Building an app that correlates to the device would in turn create location-based device that anyone can simply go onto their phone and find a homeless person whom they can help in any form they choose such as giving them food, clothing, or even a simple task or job. Funding I think should be public through donations.  Need some experienced app builders as well some knowledge in low cost GPS devices.	2019-09-10 17:01:25.89297

1121	/startup-idea/the-reverse-social-network	People often want to know what people think of them and also they want to know how to approach people to get to know them. These are two major obstacles in social interaction that can be solved with a reverse social network.\n\nThe reverse social network idea works by allowing users to sign up and their friends then fill out their profile for them. Some topics could be: What am I good at? What do I enjoy talking about? What kind of things should I work on developing? What is my background/history etc.\n\nThis concept revolves around the idea that people want to create a more personalized and individual identity for themselves in a world of information overload and noise.\n\nMonetizing: Companies could pay to be featured on the site where users could give direct feedback that is then aggregated and sent back to the company. Essentially this would be a more refined version of reviews like on Amazon because right now it gets tedious trying to read through and dissect reviews. Companies could measure real ROI on their use of the site.\n\nOf course there are a lot of holes in this idea. Help me fill them!	2019-09-10 17:01:25.89297

1131	/startup-idea/anonymous-one-click-file-hosting	So I have an Idea that I kind of like. I would like to run it by ideaswatch before I go too far on it to realize its gonna fail. Basically I want to make a website that allows you to one click upload. You don't have to register or signup. There will be a button on the top of the page that says 'upload'. When the user uploads a file (max size not determined just yet), they are redirected to the page the file sits on. Also it gives them a password that they can use later or now to change details (They can change password to fit their needs), description, filename of the file. To prevent spamming and stuff I also thought of adding in a time limit for files. The user can extend this time, (Needs password). Another feature of this site would be that the files are broadcast (if made public in the settings), but by default are private and only viewable by going to the specified link. If a public file recieves a good amount of attention, the file's time limit will be extended. At any time the user can take down the file. Also others can report files. Ideas? Comments? I would like feedback on whether to pursue this idea or not. Please and thanks.	2019-09-10 17:01:28.658319

1148	/startup-idea/predictive-hr-solution-for-hiring	One of the major challenges that most organisations face is the issue of hiring the wrong resource in the company. The blame goes to the HR. HR unit today is transforming itself into contributing back to the organisation by delivering $$ as hiring costs saved. How easy it is to really transform the new-age hiring.\n\nSolution\nI would like to design a predictive analytics solution that would be on a big data platform run on a portal, which would provide the HR to login and analyse the skills of a candidate they are looking to hire. The portal will try to extract all possible information from the web that is available of that candidate and also the predictive engine will help the HR to provide inputs around the candidate's skill relevance to the role/organisation and chances of staying for a longer duration etc. This would help the HR to start saving costs.\nAlso, the portal would offer features like Web interviews in cases where they cannot have F2F and would provide a portfolio to the HR once all steps are undertaken, the HR would get a report about the candidate potential which would help them make a decision to hire.	2019-09-10 17:01:30.187199

Wouldn't it be nice if you could hire one of them, he would give you tips, follow up your progress, answer your questions. You would also have access to their private feed, each coach would have a public feed (lke instagram) and a private feed where you can only access when being part of their team. \nFor example:\nhttps://instagram.com/fitmencook/\nHe could post all his recipes photos on his public feed, but the recipe would only be available in the private feed. The rate would be configured by the coach. What they offer to their group members would be configured by them to.\n\nIf you are a new user, you would see a general feed of all the health coaches available (just as if your instagram account was just following health coaches), you can use a filter to find your right coach. The coaches will be rated and positioned on the showcase depending of their rating. \nTheir can also be a featured coach section, and other types of "payed positioning" on the showcase, these would be services payed by the health coaches.	2019-09-10 17:01:32.184669

I am a lead developer in a small company, and when it got documentation i was lost in tones of projects (wiki, integrations). 90% were old fashion and ugly. Documentation should be fun not a torture. \nQuick story:\nAs a user i should be able to create an hierarchy of my project, with all necessary categories, code included. I should comment out my code and link it with documentation. (No more boring automatic jsdoc).   \nI am very experienced and ambitious programmer who wishes to create something really useful. \nFirst micro service should be complete in one month with open beta testing.

Data collection however is time consuming, expensive, long process and requires a lot of work. <br><br>I am therefore proposing to create a platform connecting companies and researchers in need for data. This platform connects these organisations with average people. People like you and me who could use their smartphones hourly, daily, weekly to collect needed data (eg. weather, noise, temperature, mapping or what ever else). The goal of the platform is then to connect both sides and storage the information. The system could have both paid and free data collection. Let's say there is a student wanting to collect data and could use it for free, whilst the companies would pay for the users to get the information. Ideally we could gather data ourselves as well and be able to sell it.<br><br>If anyone is interested in it, hop in.

These machines have huge amount parts, subparts operate simultaneously. the owner and operator are unaware of all the parts which are fitted in the machineries.

Like in case of a bolt gives its size,pitch etc. Later this specification and pictures are which searches the internet provides the local suppliers of the parts. These local suppliers can be charged for that.\n\nThe app should be smart enough to neglect the slight changes in the spares and search the parts accordingly.

1188	/startup-idea/civic-engagement-app	There is currently a lack of political engagement and understanding of the politics and political issues. As a result of citizen disengagement and belief that politicians won’t ‘listen’, many people shy away from politics altogether.\n\nThe purpose of the app would be to help remedy this.  An app that enables people to ‘swipe’ left/right which view on a topical policy reflects their own in comparison to their peers in geographical district & with similar voting preferences. The hope is that this would provide a more ‘engaging’ platform to debate, share and discuss political issues.\n\nSentiment analysis would be inbuilt to monitor social media feeds like Twitter and display visually, the ‘trending’ policy issues.\n\nA function to enables users to register popular grievances e.g.) areas where there are large potholes, litter, drugs etc. Results would be populated  on a ‘heat-map’ based interface.  local representative can gain a popular view of its local citizens concerns.\n\nIt is hope that the app would be of interest not only for the casual user but potentially as a tool for local representatives.  Importantly, the app would be made informative & fun as possible.	2019-09-10 17:01:38.069743

1195	/startup-idea/private-digital-library	Can you imagine a public library with thousands of books but with no librarians or catalogs? Since ancient times libraries followed the same methodology: fix item location and catalogs for recording item's location. The role of the librarians was to enforce the methodology and to make sure books and catalogs are consistent and up-to-date. \nMoving to nowadays - In terms of size and complexity the digital library of many home users resembles a public library. However, the way these users manage their library is the way they manage books in their home library – no fix locations and no catalogs. The result - many files get lost or are hard to find. And, as time goes by this problem is only getting worse.\nSo what is the solution? Simple - use the same old methodology: fixed locations and cataloging for digital files. Human librarians will be replaced by a software that will performs all library maintenance tasks.\nSome indexing and backup solutions already exist but none of them is: complete, proactive, automatic and simple enough to be suitable to the average home user\nSurprisingly implementing such solution is not that hard!\n	2019-09-10 17:01:39.651033

1197	/startup-idea/monthly-consumer-billing-quick-and-easy	Current situation:\n\nMonthly consumer bills are handled in two major ways-\n·  Debit orders.\n·  People pay their account after they receive a bill. There are various ways for people to pay, including EFT, and other payment gateways.\n\nThe problem:\n\nMany people don't trust debit orders, and they find it a hassle to pay individual accounts.\n\nPossible solution:\n\nIt seems that a convenient way to solve the problem, is to operate on a debit REQUEST, with an efficient payment interface. The consumer receives notifications of payment requests, and then selects to pay/ decline/ question an amount within an App.  The consumer could also select "Pay all", which would automatically pay all outstanding bills that are selected.\n\nThe payment method could be Visa/ Mastercard/ gateway. The consumer configures the app by entering his or her payment details, and then future payments are made with this info.  The consumer App could show outstanding bills, and past payments. The app could also show the invoice for each bill.\n\nThe company requesting payment could do so via an API/ web interface. When payment is made, their records could be updated.	2019-09-10 17:01:39.651033

So, I am thinking of leveraging smartphones' built-in technologies (e.g., GPS, Internet).\n\nAs part of solution, we need to install RFID like devices in bus/train. This device can uniquely identify bus/train and its service provider. Other related metadata (e.g., route, timings, etc.) can be stored on server. When user travels via such RFID-enabled bus/train, user's smartphone can post the RFID data along with current location to server and subsequently other commuters will be able to get the latest updates about the bus/train that they wish to catch.	2019-09-10 17:01:39.651033

Many people (namely the elderly and disabled) might be in need of some quick  heavy lifting or high out of reach work done around the home and not everyone has someone they might be able to depend on. One simple example I imagine is perhaps an elderly person wanting to put up Christmas lights which could be a little dangerous.\n\nI think it would work best as an app. Uber took the taxi industry's market by eliminating the middle man. I believe direct connecting the labor with the need for basic simple tasks could recreate the same success. \n\nFor liability purposes I would not recommend implementing  scheduling or any real hands on system simply facilitating communications so they can talk to each other and determine for themselves how best to proceed.	2019-09-10 17:01:47.064105

Can not be given to remote areas\n4.Leads to fraudulent orders, unnecessary return and misuse by the customers\n\nSolution:\nA mobile wallet targeted to ecommerce payment:\n1.Customer open wallet, get a unique wallet ID, link debit/credit card\n2. When deliveryman arrives he inputs customer's unique wallet ID, input the amount and vendor name\n3. Customer get a instant payment request and confirms via wallet\n\nBenefits:\n1. Customers still paying when the product arrives \n 2. Ecommerce merchants have direct control over their payment. Gets directly into their bank account. No cash handling\n3. Reduces risk of giving debit/credit card info at different websites. Give info at single wallet for payment at multiple sites	2019-09-10 17:01:47.064105
1230	/startup-idea/regular-rides-at-cheap-rates	There are many people who goes to a particular place regularly like an employee who goes to job six out of the seven days a week at the same place, a student who goes to school/tuition five or six days in a week and many more. Among them, there are many who don't have their own vehicles and has to go in buses,local trains,etc but they are very uncomfortable to be travelling in. Most of the times they are fully packed and stops too many times for letting passengers in & out which is often the cause for reaching late to our destination. What about creating an online platform where people facing the above mentioned problems has to book only once to enjoy the rides regularly by spending some amount of money monthly or weekly. The rides will be provided through four wheelers or two wheelers depending upon their affordability.The user will provide the time, pickup location,destination,number of seats and also will choose whether he wants a two wheeler or four wheeler for his/her rides and also if he/she wants a pool if he/she chooses a four wheeler.\n      So this was my idea, i hope you all like it and those who are interested in this idea here is my email akaz.arc99@gmail.com Thank you	2019-09-10 17:01:47.064105
1231	/startup-idea/fidget-spinner-that-charges-your-phone	Often times, our phones run out of battery when we are traveling and have no access to electricity anywhere near. A power bank may come handy but what if you use the power in a power bank as well, or you forget to charge the power bank! That's when this little device can come handy! It's like a fidget spinner that is attached to a dynamo. When you spin it, it charges your phone. When your phone has 1% of charge left and prepare to shut down, you can use it to make that one emergency call! This fidget spinner and phone charger is useful especially for people who travel a lot or enjoy camping.\n\nI'm looking for a number of co-founders with engineering or product design background to kickstart this business. Someone with video editing or ecommerce website development experience will also be welcome. This little spinner can be easily manufactured by Chinese vendors.\n\nLet's see what we can do!	2019-09-10 17:01:47.064105

There is again a group of people in the same category who possess money but do not know how to multiply it. Here is a solution proposed for both the questions. <br>                       PEER-TO-PEER LENDING. <br>In this, people can register as either borrowers or lenders. Borrower will request the amount needed and the interested lenders will propose the amount they can bear (in case, they cannot bear the full amount). <br>To control the borrowers, one can have a limit on the amount based on criteria such as <br>1. Experience, <br>2. Gratuity fund, <br>3. Provident fund details,<br>4. Variable Bonus, etc. <br><br>In case of unexpected event(demise or abscond), one can recover the amount through any of these.<br><br>Can share more details if anybody interested in designing this among Accenture Group.	2019-09-10 17:01:48.989119

According to gym accident statistics, between 1990 and 2007, over 970,000 people were treated in emergency rooms for weight training-related injuries. So if you want to workout efficiently and safely, XXX is your game changer. XXX is an app that can track your workout motion by using AI to analyse whether your gesture is correct or not so that you are training the muscle you want exactly also you can avoid injuries due to the incorrect motion(with the wrong gesture, the phone will alarm you). On the other hand, the app will build in a workout calendar function which automatically schedules your training according to your workout habit from the motion you previously tracked/videos you previously saved. It will also tell you how many calories you have burned and how many times of let's say lifting that you have done. So you can also check your workout progress.

1243	/startup-idea/drag--drop-pad-for-papers	I am not talking about electronic pads at the moment. What I miss is a real pad that could allow you to drop paper on it so it sticks (and not fall down by itself when you shake it), but still you can easily remove the paper or move it around just with your finger. The biggest point is to allow it to work with normal paper without any glue or magnetic layers so you can print or handwrite virtually anything on a simple sheet of paper and just drop it on the pad. Would be great for brainstorming or any other team work especially outside. I guess static electricity might be right way to solve it (sometimes paper sticks on my laptop screen when I try it) although there might be an issue with charging. Non-electronic device would be better I believe.	2019-09-10 17:01:48.989119

By using GPS, QR code or link, the app will decide that you are in the same room. Then you`ll type your pitch (150 characters). Then the app will show you other pitches. Send a message to script-writer, meet together and talk during/after the networking.\n\nBusiness model: I don`t have prepared, I`ll solve it with cofounders.

You click on the ones that match you and enter your age. *Loading* You now see a list of people around your area who are interested in atleast one thing as you, and you can get to chat with them through the app. You can meet them up at a location, or just exchange details for networking.

Typically, when we bring in many users, we find our server(s) overwhelmed. But then, having just welcomed hundreds/thousands of new users - we have made it so none of them can use our site.\n\nSolution: What say we build a service that allows the user to:\n1. provide JSON outputs that test site-owner defined processes, such as searches, or other database query/etc. processes that are resource-taxing, based on number of users, and perhaps location(s).  Make them JSON outputs - to keep out pests who will never become customers.\n2. test loading times based on various file-sized page elements.\n3. please add what else to add when you write osakasaul@gmail.com about joining this idea.\n\nBusiness Model: Scaled costs, depending on:\n1. complexity of processes that the client wants tested\n2. frequency of tests\n3. pay per use would cost more than 1 and 6-month plans\n4. no. of users, no.of locations to test for\n\nAre you hungry to build this with me?

For example, a birthday cake icon instead of saying Happy Birthday, or a beer icon to say "Let's go have a drink".  This idea can be generalized for all physical things.  We can develop an international language that allows people to communicate across language boundaries.  The visual elements would be supplemented with traditional text for abstract things.  All these words and icons can be chosen from a conceptually organized hierarchical menu.  So even the abstract words can be translated without much ambiguity.	2019-09-10 17:01:59.529793

Some TV providers give the possibility to choose the channels and form your own package. But we are still paying for the content from these channels which we do not watch. What if we can pay only for the program we really watch? In winter we watch TV more and we can pay more, in summer the TV vieving is going down significantly (in minutes) sa we can pay less. It will be great to get a bill a-la menu -  with clear data what and when I really have watched this month and must pay. Nothing more, nothing less. Pay only for what you watched.

1337	/startup-idea/cheap-fuel-prices	Fuel prices are always changing and its difficult to know which local fuel station is offering the cheapest prices. \nIn Australia, consumers either drive past a fuel station to find out prices per a litre or they purchase groceries from woolworths and coles to obtain a discounted fuel ticket.\nWe need to beat the supermakets and give the power back to the public.\nPeople shouldnt need to purchase groceries to get cheaper fuel and petrol stations should advertise current fuel prices.\nThose wanting to fill up should be able to choose which station they want to puchase from behorehand, based on travel distance and fuel price. The method to purchasing fuel works in two ways. The first method is to do some grocery shopping and spend over $30 to get a docket that enables us to buy cheaper fuel from supermarket owned petrol stations. Secondly the driver realises the fuel tank is nearly empty and stops at the nearest petrol station and the care factor of price depends on how desperate they are for fuel.	2019-09-10 17:02:03.372787

1343	/startup-idea/helpme	I was thinking of this idea by going a lot through quora and seeing how helpful it has been to a lot of people in many ways. However I noticed how unorganized the website was and how questions were put out "there" for anyone to answer. I was thinking of an easy and simple Iphone application where anyone could easily ask a question based on location. For example someone who first arrived in New York could easily at the airport use the app and ask for the best restaurants in town and people from the app would answer the person. Further on, I was thinking how we could arrange the questions by category so that anyone wanting to ask a question or answer a question could directly filter it and easily find it. No profiles would be required on the app and it would offer you service 24 hours since someone would always be up. Also, the question of course would delete itself after a certain period of time (24 hours) wether it has received an answer or not.	2019-09-10 17:02:03.372787

We have no chance of going out on regular weekends and if we do we look down right revolting and unapproachable. It is hard to meet people, let alone people who we have things in common with. Most of the time people shun us for choosing a career that does not require  four years of studies before starting off at the bottom. We seem unintelligent to most. But for the rest of the industry we are the most interesting, hard working and attractive people out there. Let's have a hospitality industry dating app!	2019-09-10 17:02:03.372787
1345	/startup-idea/app-for-share-car-ride-with-social-ranking	Let's say that u go to work by car alone through the same rout every day and u would like to give rides to share gas expenses or even have a little bit of profit. Two question comes in mind: how can people find out that u giving rides, in a reliable way? And how u trust those ppl? Security in this situation is a big part, something that is not an issue for apps like Lyft and Uber.\nThe answer is a share ride app with social ranking. Before even you give/receive your 1o ride, a person will be able to "vote" another person as reliable if he knows him from real life. Also, you will be able to see if the person is your friend or friend of a friend (Facebook account link). And, of course, when u give/receive a ride u will be able to rank and comment about your exp.\nFor a ride giver, it will have an option to say what path, when (or which days for a routine rout like going to work), and how much. He will be able to set a lower price for more than one person in the car.\nFor a receiver, he will be able to point on a map where he wants to be picked up, so he can find rides that pass nearby that point. Also, he will be able to set a time that he wants to be pckd up.\nPayment will be like Uber.	2019-09-10 17:02:03.372787

1347	/startup-idea/speed-dating-online-with-guaranteed-dates	The internet is over crowded with dating sites. We all know that. But the real issue with dating still hasn't been resolved. What is the main problem that all dating sites have? There is no trust. Too risky, you might end up meeting someone else then what their profile pic suggested. You might meed someone where "you don't see eye-to-eye", to put it mildly. So how can we change this? \n\nSpeed dating online. It works like this. Each night, based on your location, 10 women and 10 men meet online and have speeddating using webcam. Each couple get 10 minutes. After the end of the 10 minutes you automatically get to the next person. After you've talked to all of them. You fill out a form of the people you would like to meet again, this will be done anonymously. If there is a match between you and that person, you get eachothers contact info and arrange a date. If there is no match, you get to go to the next round, which is next night, where another speedating event will take place. The people that get matches will not be able to get to the next round until they go on their dates. \n\nSo you will be guaranteed either a date or a spot on the next round.\n	2019-09-10 17:02:05.23203

1364	/startup-idea/eavesdropping	I was at a restaurant overhearing an interesting  conversation taking place between two people on another table. I couldn't help but getting engrossed in what they were saying.

One of the most powerful tools I envision with it is building an advertising network that builds on delivering scenario, incentive triggered advertisements based on location.\n\nHere's a powerful example of how this advertising network can implemented in a mobile game:\n\n1. The ad-serve network detects that the player is near a registered advertiser, Shop A. This triggers the network to send a signal to the game, which prompts the game to present a mystery scenario.\n\n2. "A mysterious enemy has been detected lurking at location X. Head there to destroy it and earn unique treasures!"\n\n3. Once the user heads to location X, they proceed to battle the enemy and unlock a small portion of the treasure.\n\n4. "You have beaten the enemy and earned XXX gold! You also found some locked treasure. To unlock the treasure, you need a special key!\n\n5. The user, if interested or willing to spend, will be able to purchase the product at the shop to unlock his in-game goods.\n\nFind out more about the idea at http://www.bizideahive.com/free-business-ideas/internet-business-ideas-augmented-reality-advertising	2019-09-10 17:02:08.047205

After you have done it, the wallpaper stripper sits in your garage or attic for the next 5 years. <br><br>Solution<br>I propose a sharing cost system with people of your own city or nearby could use and then re-sell the stuff.

Merging Knowledge platform will allow people submit their ideas to public opinion to get real insights from people who might already know the sector or have some experience on similar projects in order to give them valuable opinions. The best ranked ideas, checked and supported by a selected network of menthors, coaches and investors will follow the process to finance their project. This interactive platform will let entrepeneurs with different backgrounds to discuss online, skype or even team up in order to share knowledge, capabilities and professional experience. The platform will also focus on giving support to initiatives that involve  disabled people in their team.	2019-09-10 17:02:11.826082
1413	/startup-idea/traffic-updates---no-wastage-of-time	we are very irritated because of the traffic problems now a days.So my idea is to create a app which shows all the traffic updates. The app uses our location access and will notify us whenever we are going somewhere to a traffic place. it will also inform us the time at which it is going to be clear. If we just type the place, we can be able to know the traffic updates regarding that place. This is simple and very much useful especially in India.	2019-09-10 17:02:11.826082
1414	/startup-idea/app-to-incentivize-fact-checking--fight-fake-news	I'm working on an app that acts as a decentralized news stream. What this means is that instead of news being created or filtered from the top down, readers of the newspapers themselves will create the content.  However, users post against their own credit that they load with real money; whether their contribution is upvoted or downvoted determines their profit/loss respectively.\n\nWhat's to stop users from voting based on their political affiliations and not according to due diligence of the facts?  Similar to posting articles, voting is also grounds for gaining/losing credit.  Users who do not fact-check but vote just to influence popular opinion can expect to lose money because others who fact-check for profit will not vote the same.  \n\nThe output will be a news stream that is filtered to be as credible as possible because it leverages self-interest in humans.  I believe this is the best way to fight fake news.\n	2019-09-10 17:02:11.826082

Their profiles will be listed in the website so that whoever is in need of work (Client) will visit the site and invite the designer for the work. An email will be sent to the designer. If he is interested he will reply back to his client and hence both client and the designer will be mutually beneficial.\nThis will be upgraded to other streams later based on site traffic.

1416	/startup-idea/student-pilot-partner	Problem: There are huge number of b2c startups  coming up, Most of these startups fail because the MVP isn't piloted properly with large number of people. This makes the startup not get honest feedbacks on the idea and also identify crucial flaws and loopholes. \n\nMost of the MVPs have to be tested out on students because students tend to adopt to any disruptive idea quicker and also it is the quickest way to market the product. But in the current scenario, most of the startups doesn't have direct access to college students.\n\nSolution:  Create a platform having network of students who are signed up. The b2c startups who want to do pilots can directly connect with students signed up in this platform and ask them to use and test out the product and get feedbacks from them.\nSince they have access to huge number of students from multiple colleges,  the startups also get free marketing. Also for the students to enroll, some perks are provided for using and feedback of each MVP.	2019-09-10 17:02:14.221103

As a result, he/ she is not aware the areas of improvement.Even if skill setwise they are good and didnt get job because of some other reasons, still they are not aware the reason for rejection. If the candidate gets feedback in three categories like  selected, sourced, and rejected with reasons, it will help both job seekers as well as recruiters.

You can leave a comment on the location, rate it and even report it if it's a scam. \n\nWhy is this a usefull app? -> It's something new (I guess), risked and it's interesting to test out as a mobile phone user.\nWhy would people use this? -> People have always wanted to discover more than just their own comfort area. This app allows them to find locations that only people consider "good" and this makes it a lot easier for people to also find locations to go to when they're on vacation.\n\nThis apps has a lot of potential, we can add new features like a profile, score and even a friendssystem. \n\nFor more information: simonkuhn2001@hotmail.com\n© Simon Kuhn, all rights served.	2019-09-10 17:02:14.221103

1445	/startup-idea/dropfare---get-the-lowest-airfare-everytime	My idea is named DropFare. I came up with it roughly a year ago and haven't done much on it, but it would have to be developed at a beta phase just to test it out. It is a system designed to get the lowest airfare from around the web from the very first search, so if they were to search for a better deal on orbitz or expedia etc they likely would not find it about 85% of the time (depending on where they live)\n\nI know the formula to test this theory but again it would have to be built first. Imagine building a travel site like expedia, but it would have another layer added that has never been done and hopefully no one has yet to think of. If it can be built, I do have many large contacts in different industries to effectively raise capital and market it for a launch. Would be extremely profitable IF all goes well. \n\n\nHave very little experience with building programs and have zero coding skills myself. fyi\nLooking for builders!

The screen should display notes of all small denominations like 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100. They should be able to select them with a touch the Note they want to swap for the products they buy. With a swipe of their hand(upwards) the customer should be able to send and the receiving retailers mobile should display (showing inward) with the Customer's name inscribed on the notes(in a corner).When the semi-literate person sees his cash(with his name)  on the screen of the receiver, he will believe in the whole transaction. And the receiving retailer also can not deny that the amount has not been received by him. For usage of multiple number of notes also the app should accommodate the viewing of all notes placed one behind the other. This kind of app improves the confidence of semi-literate people of in mobile transactions and can adopt digital transactions quickly.

The advent of massive open online courses offered alternatives to the traditional higher education but fall short of offering the same benefits which universities and internships provide, in particular, the ability to advance through a career development process with peers, networking with professionals, alumni and recruiters, and a clear path to employment. Coding bootcamps and career accelerators address these shortcomings at a steep cost and are no better in job placement rates than college grads.\n\nLooseLeaf is a project-based professional networking platform for aspiring newcomers of the tech and creative industries to try out a career path, improve their knowledge and skills, build an online portfolio, and acquire relevant work experience and receive mentorship through completing projects  for non-profits, entrepreneurs, and intrapreneurs.	2019-09-10 17:02:21.151379
1450	/startup-idea/daily-matches-app-the-future-of-online-dating	Daily Matches will introduce completely new concepts aimed to enhance what users love most about dating apps while taking bold steps to fix why people dislike today's dating apps.\n\nHow it works:\nDM's - Every 24hrs you're automatically matched with 2 users who meet your ideal preferences and share chemistry with you (known as your DM's). There is a timer always counting down the seconds to the next day, and when the timer reaches zero, you will get your two matches for the day as well as their pVid.\npVid (snapchat like feature) -Creative 10-30 second vid sent to your DM's when you first match. You can clip a scene from a movie/TV show or record yourself to highlight your personality or expectations. \n\nSP (Social Points) -SP is gained every time you interact with your DM's. The mutual benefit of gaining points through conversation will make sending "ice breakers" less daunting and awkward.\n\nSP can be used to be Premium Arrows and features. Each Arrow/feature will heavily increase the chances of you finding your perfect match. Example: Silver Arrow - Receive 3 DM's the following day instead of 2.\n\nDaily Matches boasts other new concepts such as: Date Rate, Meme Chemistry and more!\n	2019-09-10 17:02:17.087567

That's why I, a thirteen year old is here. I have the solution. I will have an app, where people can start there sneaker shop of exclusive sneakers, free of charge. (if) The reseller starts to sell, he/she will get returning customers, resellers can also advertise on a special page, which shows what kind of shoes they have, how many sales they did etc. If there are plural of the same pairs on a typed in keyword, the one with the highest sales will get higher. Resellers can also get higher sales by doing advertisements (on the special page) and get higher results. The customer, has options to the price range, color, size, gender, etc. Also, the first exclusive feature for the customer is that they can see how the shoe fits on her/his feet, by using the camera of the mobile phone. More exclusive features will come later with the app. <br><br>Please comment down below, if you're interested in realising this project/investing the project.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Mark M.<br>	2019-09-10 17:02:17.087567

1457	/startup-idea/shoe-marketplace	A website where all buyers, sellers, and traders of old shoes are gathered into a marketplace. Old shoe sellers could showcase their shoes according to the brand. Resellers of shoes and limited edition shoes are also welcomed and could build up their portfolio to attract customers. I have seen many facebook, twitter, instagram profiles of resellers. I've tried to search a shoe once and it's kind of tiring to see how the profiles are so scattered and some people who are indeed selling are so hard to find. I am envisioning a website where they all gather and showcase their limited edition, used shoes and others where buyers can search with one click and find everything there. This shoe marketplace is strictly for shoes and non other than shoes, shoes of different brands but not pants, shirts or other fashionable items. I'm trying to focus it on the Philippines right now, but you other kind people could help and establish this in your own respective countries.	2019-09-10 17:02:17.087567

1481	/startup-idea/personal-shopping-avatar	So everyone knows about online shopping by now, in particular purchasing clothes. The problem i find is how can you be sure that they will fit and match your bodies size and shape. Well Idea # 1 has a possible solution. What about a suit, with a similar look to a wetsuit with a usb connection that measures every surface of you body and creates a perfect online avatar that you could use to model your clothes on the screen. The suit could easily be brought over the internet and shipped to a consumers home, but might be to expensive to make. If the suits were to expensive to make then perhaps consumers could be measured at selected "measuring zones or sites" inside shopping centres and have an online avatar of themselves made on the spot. Of couse this is no small idea, the size labeling of clothing varies from country to country and any clothing company that wanted this sort of service would have to supply very specific measurements of all of the products and each individual size	2019-09-10 17:02:23.253723

1495	/startup-idea/flash-drive-cane	In the old days, it was considered cool to carry a cane that contained a hidden sword with which you could skewer your enemies.  A simple twist of the handle would allow for a blade to be dislodged for use in dissuading muggers or dispatching those who doubted the honor of your wife or mother.\n\nToday, that kind of thing will get you a prison boyfriend by way of a TSA full body massage.\n\nBut what if you could arm yourself with information instead of a blade?  Enter the Flash Drive Cane, or Flash Cane.  \n\nInside the cane a small extension USB cable could be stored which would connect to an array of interconnected 64gb flash drives.  When the handle is removed, it reveals the plug for the USB cable which can be pulled out a few feet and plugged into a USB port on any computer.  This port would power the USB drives and allow for storage of 500-600 GB of information.  Best of all, when you're done, you simply tug on the cable and it returns to the coil within the cane.  \n\nNow your cane is not only good for walking, but also surfing.	2019-09-10 17:02:25.203415

In contrast first-person shooter games are exciting and fun and they bring a sense of testosterone release.\n\nHow about having a group that organizes playoff of first-person shooter games in real life? It can be as macho as paintball wargames or as cheap as waterguns or soft-splat guns.

1499	/startup-idea/space-travel	Ever heard of BIo Wifi? Could  it be the next big thing.  It could revolutionize  space travel if harnessed properly. If a plan is framed out and executed around the concept of sustainable space travel, this could become a reality in our lifetime.  Possibly allowing animals , eventually humans to take solo or group missions to other planets. Researchers in Standford University have been able to control some cell functions via the web. This can lead to various application  pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fuel, etc. Fuel, life support and possibly food  can be harnessed in an unique way to promote space travel in which cells would produce sustainable rocket fuel, air to breathe,  H20 to drink, A possible dietary energy soucre, etc.  This could change mankind forever. Stanford may eventually patent the the research,  but I hope it would allow for some kind of opeportnity where many companies could partake in different asects of such an endeavor.

1527	/startup-idea/retailer-networking-in-developing-economies-	Browse > Choose > Order > Deliver\nIs the most popular shopping trend in developing economies like India, China & Brazil to name a few.\n\nThe stake holders in this game are predominantly a seller & a buyer. If we where to broadly further classify the seller - I would assume it to be an seller from an organized retail background and one from the unorganized segment. Its natural to assume, the participation in the e-com space from players in the organized space is significantly higher than the later.\n\nThis presents an opportunity to develop a ecosystem focused primarily at the sellers (and also buyers) who are aspirational, however don't have the knowledge, infrastructure and logistical support to participate in this growing trend. This idea revolves around creating a ecosystem focused primarily at such participants. Apart from being a viable financial business model, I think it also serves a social cause by making it easier for a larger section of the seller community in participate in the economic boom (esp in developing markets).\n\nLooking for IT experts, people with a business acumen, legal experts and anyone with similar ideas to collaborate and join hands on this project.	2019-09-10 17:02:28.434257

For example a company wants to receive feedback or spread their product. So they can cooperate with the taxi company and for example buy 1000 surveys/polls. Then during the drive the people have to edit this surveys/polls. Or a company could share for example a new perfume for women. Then the taxi driver gives every women a small sample and the chance to buy it.

1550	/startup-idea/idea-funnel	First, this is a complement to IdeasWatch, not a replacement.  The pain point is filling the gap between inception to a successful execution: Inception to productization.  \nThe concept is for an ideal to get through several social levels where different criteria and expertise are applied and either rejected or accepted, which results in the idea passing to the next level. \nAn engine like this can then be licensed to several enterprises.	2019-09-10 17:02:31.921811
1551	/startup-idea/crowd-sourced-surveillance	I'm currently a student doing a study on crime prevention through environmental design at train stations.

1552	/startup-idea/an-alternative-to-self-destructing-text-messaging	A text messaging app that sends and receives messages that gradually fade/dim until the text is not visible. This happens within a few seconds of receiving the text. To see the text, the recipient has to touch the message box/or UI. The text brightens/illuminates back into visibility only if the app recognizes the fingerprint. If the app does not recognize the finger print, it won’t illuminate the text. The text stays visible for a few seconds and then dims back into invisibility.	2019-09-10 17:02:31.921811
1553	/startup-idea/anonymous-on-mainstream-social-networks	'Quiet":<br>A software (app) that paranoid people can use to post on their social media streams anonymously.<br><br>Scenario:<br>?1- One would set up a Twitter account using all measures of anonymity. (No one knows him)<br>2- He uses this software (which I'll dub "Quiet" from now on) to post without ever accessing that Twitter account<br>2a- What happens in No. 2 above is that the app authenticates, gets a granted permission to post to Twitter, and then receives your input (the Tweet), and post it to Twitter through an exit relay of TOR (or VPN but this is less secure).<br><br>Result:<br>You can post to your (mainstream social network of) Twitter without ever being tied to those posts. Thus eliminating any possible tracks, ads, or personally identifying information being sent to Twitter.<br><br>The difference between a VPN, Proxy and Quiet is that when you have the app, say on your phone, then you have to take NO MEASURES whatsoever to anonymize your posts location of origin. You just write your message in the app, and it takes care of rerouting the traffic through TOR's decentralized network (or their own servers in case of VPN-like solution) to then post to the social network without having your IP ever sent.<br>	2019-09-10 17:02:31.921811

As a multilevel, each person who buys a computer or takes a class has an incentive to become a distributor: find clients themselves and sell computers and teach classes. The clients would have to pay a small fee to the distributor to become a distributor; this is the incentive to become a distributor, other than the profit from selling computers and teaching classes.	2019-09-10 17:02:33.122625

This is about a store which make online orders to Amazon & Ebay for its customers since most of Myanmar persons do not have credit cards to make online orders directly to Global E-commerce website. Also we can find another similar service shop managed by Korean in Yangon.\n\nMixing my international biz experience in S.E. Asia with this inspiration from examples above,  now I am planning to set up the same concept shop, where local customers make online order, settle payment, and pick up their deliveries.  Besides online orders agent to Amazon and Ebay, I will provide online store and mobile apps in local languages.

1568	/startup-idea/bounty-based-reversed-crowdfunding	Something like ideaswatch + kickstarter.\nOn typical crowdfunding site you post your project and wait for money. Here is what I call "reversal":\nThere are two phases: in first, visitors post their ideas and needs or browse those created by others. They can also  put any amount of money into escrow, saying: I'm paying this much to someone, who will solve this problem.\nSecond phase is typical crowdfunding campaign.\n\nAnd here is my idea (probably wrong, but maybe you can thing of something better) how transition occurs: you can set your campaign and declare it as solving this particual pain. Then people engaged in putting their money into this pain vote (votes should have some weight based on money) and if, for example, 75% of them votes 'yes', money is transfered to the campaign.\n	2019-09-10 17:02:33.122625

I want to see my lil man's big 7 party from every view point posted in one place and viewable in an Instant. I want to see the pics and vids without having to sort through all the other pics and vids each of my family members have posted to each of their social accounts whenever they get to posting them. That's frustrating and exhausting! I just want to see my son's birthday from every angle recorded by everybody there right then because I'm a crazy dad like that... And because I'm a crazy sports fan too I'd love to have this at ballgames too.\n\nSo whether it's with close family or a stadium of strangers I want to see their view of what I'm experiencing with them in that Instant.\n\nDo you like this concept?

Not only will you see the environment, you can see some of the people. The video is meant to just be a sneak peek. Videos can be tailored to each company. I imagine an engaged job seeker. The seeker will can get a glimpse enough to say, yes that looks like something I can do or possibly say, no way.

Then if other late student come the automatic glass door sensor will detect their motion and open when they want to enter the class. So the teacher will don't have to stop their lessons to open the door for the incoming late students.	2019-09-10 17:02:37.648399

1595	/startup-idea/home-party-finder	A problem teenagers often face is that they are underaged and won't get into any clubs. Instead, they throw home party's. However, often teenagers struggle to throw a successful home party because not enough people show up to make it fun. Another problem teenagers face is that if none of their close personal friends throw a home party they can't go to any other party. The solution to this: an app where a host can advertise his/her party to anyone that wants to come. This home party then appears on a map and anyone using the app in the same location can see the location of the home party and any details the host added about the party. This brings together teenagers from all over the city, creates new friendships and fun nights together.	2019-09-10 17:02:37.648399
1596	/startup-idea/queit---managing-queues	Would you be interested in using such a web service? \n\nI had this problem in a team - we had one remote workstation that we constantly needed to use, and everybody were running around asking everybody on the team - "are you using the workstation? how long will you be using it?" etc. \n\nI am currently developing a web app to solve this and similar problems (applications are vast - remote machine, office toilet, some game at office's game room, shower, or a book in library, etc)\n\nQueit - you can create a queue, add activities to it. Also other users can add activities to a queue. \n\nThis way you can see who is currently using something that you need,also the user can specify what he is doing and for how long will be doing it. You can add an activity to the queue, saving a place for yourself.

1597	/startup-idea/new-frontend-development-language-for-the-web	My problem is that there isn't any really good tools to develop frontend. There are tons of great tools and frameworks for HTML, CSS, and JS but it's still JS which I think isn't the answer for this question. I think a new language which is built from the ground up to serve frontend development can be the solution. The imagined language and framework will have the following features:\n - Declarative syntax for UI building (instead of HTML)\n - Databinging\n - Easy animations\n - Redesigned styleing system (instead of CSS)\n - Statically typed\n - Object oriented and functional programming mix and match\n - Develop and test the full frontend without the need of the backend, with REST mocks\n - UI widget library on top of HTML\n - Resuable custom component creation\n - Instant preview (like in HTML, save and reload)\n - Transpiled to HTML, CSS\n - Debuggable (both code and component structure)	2019-09-10 17:02:37.648399

With fears of copycats, the teams conceal the ideas from the market they are targeting until they will launch them. It happens especially to the project groups who are aiming the overseas market. \n\nWhy don't they reveals the idea to public and get feed backs from targeted users/customers, providing them a chance to modify and allowing to build certainty about the idea's future behavior. \n\nIf so, they will not only be able to reduce the cost of marketing and advertising cost of their future products, but will also minimize the risks. \n \nHence, I believe that building a platform in both app and web where startups can freely upload their 'landing pages' or 'beta versions’ will help startups in many ways.\n\nI have two specific ways to assist startups in financially in linguistically.

1636	/startup-idea/midnight-food-express	I have faced this issue, and I guess many of you guys must have experienced it yourself as well.\nWhat if you are hungry at 2AM, and theres hardly anything interesting to eat at home? The options you have is either go back to bed or drive to a nearby late night food joint, wherein the options are pretty limited. Like for eg. I wouldnt know from where I could get a Pizza or a cheese burger at 3AM in Mumbai (India).\nNow what if there's an app that has a tie up with all these late night food joints and provide home delivery options. Surely this will have different module for each city, wherein the food options are available as per the late night restaurants/joints/shacks.	2019-09-10 17:02:41.201258

1641	/startup-idea/garagee	It is very common for people in the U.S.A to make their garages their personal place. Whether they transform their 30x30 into a gym, meditation room, billiards and table tennis  or video game room.Garages are utilized everywhere for fun instead of parking  cars. So what if there was an app that connected garage owners with people looking for entertainment?\nWhat I mean is simple the app user has four payment offers\n2 garages=$10 a month\n4 garages=$18 a month \n6 garages=$25 a month\nUnlimited=$40 a month\nSome examples of what the Garage membership would offer:\n-Relaxation Center (Yoga, sleep, meditation)\n-Homework and Work Center\n-Gym \n-Library\n-Gaming Center (Videogames)\n-Tan Salon\n-Jacuzzi\n-table football, billiards, and table tennis center\nand many more\nOkay but what does the Garage owner get in return?\nSimple, enough money to possibly pay rent\nGiven the logistics if an estimate of 30 persons visit your "Center"a day it could profit the owner anywhere from $350-$1000 dollars a month., and he does not need to be there. He simply locks the door from his garage to his house just as he would lock the door of his front door, and the money comes in easy for him.\n\n	2019-09-10 17:02:42.802994

1644	/startup-idea/pills-n-tablets	Problem: Patient gets doctor prescription.  Patient would have to go to a medical shop and buy at the price the medical shop charges them.  Currently there is less competition and hence patient have to cough up more money.<br><br>Solution: An app where doctor, patient and medical shops can register.  Doctor should be able to provide e-prescription in this app.  Patient gets to choose or let the app decide on the list (say max 10) medical shops.   Medical shops also will get the e-prescription of the patient for which they can send quotation to the patient in this app. Then Patient gets to decide the medical shop from where he wants it to be delivered.<br><br>Currently Netmed is there but you will have to place an order. But here I am referring to order directly going to registered medical shops and patient getting the choice according to their need.	2019-09-10 17:02:42.802994
1645	/startup-idea/online-mobile-game-based-on-trade-economy	My game idea is based on interaction between players where they will buy and sell each other virtual products (from iron to aircraft). Each product will have its quality coefficient so you will have to use price/quality ratio to find most affordable products.  You will buy quality but cheap products and then will sell it with more price  Also there will be a product maintenance feature with what you will increase the quality of your products, to create a better value for the further sale. In advance, there will auction feature where buyers will fight for a product and seller will get more or less of excepted income. It s possible to create more and more features for fun	2019-09-10 17:02:42.802994
1646	/startup-idea/liquid-system-to-control-iso-document-in-company	Almost all companies & organizations apply standards ISO 9001 (Quality Management System) where all activities must be recorded.\nTo run it some use ERP systems and supported by a lot of reports in hardcopy.\nProblem:\n1. ERP tend to be expensive, inflexible, much additional indirect costs after implementation.\n2. Data and supporting records are usually stored in hardcopy.\nSolution:\nCreating a database system where certain admin user (non IT Staff) can create and edit their own basic form. Other users can only fill or read data. Users also do not need to create and make the relationships between databases, they just set the relation between their form.\nHow to:\nI'll try to explain a little detail as simple as possible flow process to open the data record.\n1. Open blank Form.\n2. Load forms shape form (location of the tool and its properties (font, size, etc)) from the database.\n3. Load data from the database and input to the tool (Textboxt, Label, Table, etc).\nThis system would involve insane coding and data mining. I've tried to make in VB (2010).

1651	/startup-idea/searching-for-available-and-relevant-activities	My idea is to create an app which let you find activities as sports, movies, theaters, cultural events, music events and others. The problem of current apps as yelp, foursquare is that you find all places in the are. I want to make service providers to cooperate with customers, they will be supposed to provide opening hours, to inform if places are sold out. \n\nSo customers will search through categories and find only the activities which are free for chosen filter, it means people will fill a day, time, place and other requirements and get a list of available activities, for example they get a list of movies they can watch in their city tonight, with prices and other characteristics. They will see all the movies in the city on one place and they will be free to book or buy directly their seats.\n\nThe revenues will be from service providers for a made reservation as a percentage of the ticket price. People will get a discount for using the app. \n\nThe app will bring customers to service providers and help customers to find the best place to have a fun.	2019-09-10 17:02:42.802994

1659	/startup-idea/car-sharing-apps	Every day we travel on road for office, home, job, education, health, travel and for so many purpose. Everywhere public transport are not on door step or every one able to have own car. Sometimes even having a car we cant drive if we go to airport or rail stations. If there is an app that connects people with private/commercial car, we can share a car journey with our fellow passenger. For example, if we daily travel on road for our office /institutions, few of us can have almost matched time & destination. We can share car for our every day travel. Similarly one have a private car and have less money for fuel to travel every day by own car, he can get some co passengers though app who can share his cost. He will pick up and drop them every day and also do same at return time. It can be manged through app. If his office time changes, he can also manage new passenger. For commercial car driver it will have better advantage. He can upload his travel route and time in App, and get sufficient passenger during up journey and down journey. It will help him to make business in some certain routes and reduces random travelling in all areas to collect single or few passengers.	2019-09-10 17:02:43.920068

1660	/startup-idea/local-eats	Where do the locals eat?\nMy dad had a rather unique way of finding a good restaurant. He would often say to me that if, for example, it was Chinese food you were after, then follow a local Chinese person around and see where he or she eats! He figured that the best way to tell if a Chinese restaurant was any good was if Chinese people ate in it!\n\nThis is where this idea originated. I would like your feedback on developing a review App that has a similar feel to foodspotting (rating a dish rather than the restaurant) but with a social aspect being able to ‘follow’ a local Asian or local Italian expert as an example. The aim is to discover not only where the locals are eating, but what they are eating as well. So if there is a large number of Italians eating lasagne at “Luigi’s Restaurant”, then I know it must be good!\n\nYou can also ‘follow’ friends whose opinions you value to see what and where they are eating. Users of the App can also rate the reviewers/recommendations made by the ‘local expert’ (like a thumbs up or thumbs down but with a twist).	2019-09-10 17:02:43.920068

1677	/startup-idea/veo---youtube-alternative	The problem:\nYoutube is the best option we have when it comes to sharing your videos with a community. Channel Owners still use other platforms such as Twitter, Reddit and Facebook to communicate with their audience. This is a huge problem because it takes people away from your channel and potentially watching more videos, and yet it's essential when trying to grow a strong community by engaging with an audience. Youtube's commenting system is not cutting it.\n\nThe idea:\nVeo is a video sharing platform similar to Youtube that will give Channel Owners a lot more power over their channels that they don't currently have with Youtube. Being able to do things such as add channel moderators, set rules for comments, these are huge for increasing engagement which is very important when growing a community.\n\nThere are two more "core" features planned for this platform.

Just take a look at the few examples below:\n\nI live in Tehran. Very big city. I want to rent a house but I am tired of actually going to different real state agencies. I wish there was a website where I could find a house to rent online.\n\nI am a youtube singer. I don't get much attention and my videos do not get viewed enough. I wish there was a website where I could sign up in singing competitions and maybe attract more viewers to my youtube channel.\n\nI am a piano teacher. I do not get much students these days. I wish there was a website where I could find students in my city or they could find me.\n\nPeople can vote for needs submitted by others near them indicating that this need is more serious.

If I had that option - I would construct a whole new structure on 6-10 steel pillars that will support a second roof 1 meter higher than the existing house roof. The second roof will mimic the shape of the existing roof and be entirely made of solar panels. That way I will have what I need:\n1. Large solar panel surface that will produce much more electricity than the regular roof solar panels.\n2. House will be shielded from elements - no roof repairs and leaks!\n3. Upper floor will not be heated from the direct sunlight - resulting in lower temperature in summers and also higher temp in winter since the winds will not hit the roof directly.\n4 No additional weight on the house structure and roof - since the solar shield will be on steel pillars outside of the house.\n5.Overall lots of power savings, comfort and savings from repairs - the whole structure can be removable if needed - so no construction damage on the house.\n6. Plenty of work for steel producers and solar panel producers!\n	2019-09-10 17:02:45.100369

1704	/startup-idea/music-of-your-own-attached-to-a-gift	Every one of us likes music of one kind or another. Isn’t it great if you could add music of your creation to the gift for your loved one? \n\nThe idea is to connect gift senders with music composers. The gift sender gives a key melody that will be a theme of the entire piece of music, together with the image they have in mind, such as what the occasion is, who the receiver is, what instrument they want their music to be composed on, and so on (the more in detail, the better for the composer to make music). Then registered members of composers give a sample piece on the theme to the gift sender, and s/he picks up one. Since the music is only an extra to the main gift, it shouldn’t be long. If successful, it is ideal if this app can be tied up with shopping sites so that customers can choose the option of “music” just like adding wrapping service to their shopping cart.  \n  \nWell, this is my idea of new app that plays its role in conveying your feeling of love, fun, or even anger (!?) with the actual gift! \n\nThank you for sparing your time for reading this. I hope someone out there will work with me and realize this idea! \n	2019-09-10 17:02:47.015155

1707	/startup-idea/web-app-to-share-the-actions-of-pay-it-forward	Why I got this idea:\nDo you know the movie "Pay It Forward"? "One day, a teacher gives the class an assignment to devise and put into action a plan that will change the world for the better. A boy's plan is a charitable program based on the networking of good deeds. He calls his plan "pay it forward", which means the recipient of a favor does a favor for three others rather than paying the favor back." (Quoted from Wikipedia) He thinks that people's goodwill and compassion will spread and the world will be better by continuing this movement. I thought it would be nice if there was a web service that allows users to record and share the actions of this “Pay It Forward” to change the world for the better.\n\nWhat the users can do on this web service:\n-Post what you received from someone and what you did for 3 others\n-Receive “Good!” from other users\n-Watch other user’s actions of “Pay It Forward” on timeline\n-Use Android app and iOS app\n-Search other user’s posts by free word, country and language.\n-And etc.\n\nHere is some more information.\nhttps://goo.gl/OIQ8Kk\n\nThank you for reading to the end.

1729	/startup-idea/pos-it	The idea is fairly simple, a Point of Sale system that does more than just Point of Sale tasks. I want to create a system that allows a business to work off one system for all their primary needs. \n\nThis includes time clock and scheduling, Point of sale, inventory management, procurement and I think some API calls would be awesome for cross-checking competitor pricing. As well as looking at services such as Amazon to check if the business is buying their product at the lowest price available. Obviously this can spiral into a large group of external services such as Paypal and things.\n\nThis system will have to have multiple modes it can run in, either for a retail environment or for a restaurant environment. With the restaurant environment I would like to see an automated ordering system of some kind so that customers can order from their mobile device or a small device provided at the table.\n\nOne of the main requirements for the end system is to be able to run the client software (the actual POS It interface) on a small form factor device such as a Raspberry pi.\n\nThere are many more ideas I have for a final product, but this is a good start!\n\nHope you like the idea!	2019-09-10 17:02:49.284749

1739	/startup-idea/everything-for-free	A concept where you can buy things or services without money. \n\nHow It Works?\n============\nEverything has points instead of price. If you want to buy a service or a thing you need to have as many points as required.\n\nTo earn points you need to provide any service you are good at or a product you own to other members in need free of cost.\n\nTherefore, it is sort of barter system where you provide others with services free of cost and in return you earn points which subsequently allow you to buy things and services free of cost.	2019-09-10 17:02:51.77847

To document how things are done differently in different countries by different people. Users could submit their own knowledge, Ratings and  comments could be applied for credibility and to define the best method. This would be worldwide, with information on multiple life questions which are asked every day, in different countries and languages. Information could be collected using various Google searches and personal questions to people who have experienced the subject but would be locked to the simple format of the app. Data could be stored in the cloud or downloaded for offline use.	2019-09-10 17:02:51.77847

1769	/startup-idea/let-typing-be-a-game	We all know how frustrating it can be to type on the small keyboard that appears at the bottom of a touch-screen. Typing seems to be the only good way of input, with speech recognition technology and such others still not up to the mark. Most of the time on our smartphones is spent on typing  (chat, email, sms etc.). So why not make the experience of typing more game-like and exciting?! That could keep the smartphone users engaged and entertained.\n\nI have a few ideas. I am not well-versed with android game development. Hence I don’t know how feasible these ideas are :\n1. Weapons/War keyboard :  A fancy designed keyboard points a small gun at the cursor and shoots letters in place as we press the corresponding keys. A flame-thrower erases unwanted letters when we hit back space. We could also modify the cursor to look like an enemy tank/fighter jet... \n2. Rain keyboard : A small cloud hovers at the top of the screen and drops letters like rain-drops. Perhaps, we could use lightning to erase letters..\n\nTo make it more fun, we can set missions and status rewards for the user (for example, typing speed, combo/streak, no. of letters typed per day, etc.).

1772	/startup-idea/escrow-service-for-cryptocurrency	People are starting to utilise crypto to buy items and assets and the problem is sending and receiving money! Once you send funds to someone you can not retrieve it back without the receiver returning it back. No way of claiming it back. Therefore a trustful escrow service will be your middle man to receive and release funds once both parties are happy! Commission based model will benefit the company.\n\nTherefore need a secure software which is transparent for both parties to view funds in wallet before releasing.	2019-09-10 17:02:53.752446

In order to address this issue I intend to develop a platform which will enable users to get in touch with people having similar sports interests around their locations.

The model is kind of Auction. Pharmacies/Drugstore will be registered with the application to sell the medicine and Patience/Customer will upload their Prescription to check the market price. After receiving a new prescription, every registered pharmacy will get a chance to offer price for the prescribed medicine. Then customer/patients can see all the prices have been offered; then they can purchase with the option PURCHASE AND COLLECT or PURCHASE AND ARRANGE DELIVERY. Same goes for the Lab test as well. \n\nI think this kind of startup will work in developing counties such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, etc. Because in these countries in average 60-70% people visit private doctor/hospital, and they pay for their doctor visit, medicine & Lab test. And mobile internet penetration is also increasing day by day. \n\nKindly share your valuable feedback, if you have seen anything like this working anywhere.  \n	2019-09-10 17:02:54.787708

Since we are connected to WIFI almost everywhere at Home or public network this will help to reduce the dependency on wired charging. This is just an idea, I am not sure if technically it is feasible, but if this idea can be turned to reality, it would be game changer in the mobile charging space.	2019-09-10 17:02:55.790594

1799	/startup-idea/paid-lift	Problem: Nowadays, the problem is that mostly people travel by their own car, which means only one person is driving the whole vehicle with a capacity of 5 people. It means that 80% of the energy of the vehicle is being wasted. The reason for this is that the people who work at the same place might not live in a same locality, so that is why they travel alone in their cars. In short environment is getting polluted.\n\nSolution: The solution for this problem can  be that, making an app through which the people coming in the route of the person having the same destination, can take a lift from the person who is travelling by his/her and also he/she can pay for that but a reasonable price. This in turn will result in two things, firstly: 100% usage of the energy of the vehicle and seondly: the vehicle owner can also make some money.	2019-09-10 17:02:55.790594

This involves usless movement of the right hand from and to the keyboard, what is imo useless and counterproductive. Some substitutes for the mouse exist such as the touchpad or the joystick. I believe neither of the two is a suitable substitute for using the mouse. I would therefore like to see a product that would enable us to use the mouse WHILE having our hands in a typing position on the keyboard - some kind of sensor for the right hand perhaps.

It´s not cool to use slippers because you loose mobility and you can´t run on all places or sliders wearing them, also when you get wet you get slick using them so you can fall if you run to fast, on the other hand running and going arround all the waterpark all day long makes your feet get scratched or burned because the sun will make the floor get hot on some areas of the park. So imagine all the day running and playing on the park with no protection to your foot, you cant use slippers. At the end of the day you are with your feet scratched and burned, so if we had a great easy to use and confortable durable sticker we could use it to play and them remove it and all done.	2019-09-10 17:02:56.841471

1826	/startup-idea/the-influence-trade-center	Take a look at http://www.growsocials.com/index.php and you will see that you can earn points or buy them, and allocate them as you like - to collect Facebook Fanpage likes, G+ on your blog articles, get circled in G+, and even get followed in Twitter.  If you use Empire Avenue, you see "Missions," and understand that everything is up for sale in influence, reputation scoring and it is all getting "gamed": people buy and sell votes, upmarks, etc.\nWho could do the backend for something like GrowSocials - to work with G+ (I have ideas beyond those in GS), Klout, Facebook, etc.?  Experience with oAuths and APIs preferred - or, at least the willingness to learn.\nWho is interested in being the frontend web designer - to work with us on ideas to make something more fluid and columned, and thus far faster to use than GS?\nPartner with me on this fast - those "in the know," you know this is immediately monetizable and is needed by many small and mid-sized businesses.	2019-09-10 17:02:57.895777
1827	/startup-idea/office-plants-community	Having plants in the cubicle helps liven things up an otherwise sterile office. However some research have shown only a small number of plant species are net oxygen producers when placed indoors under artificial light -- a fact not known by most cubicle dwellers. Potted plants also need special care, just like any other pets. Sadly not many people know how to take care of the simplest potted plants like small cactuses, which causes unnecessary deaths of those helpless vegetations.	2019-09-10 17:02:57.895777
1828	/startup-idea/wordofmouth--medical-course-review-site	Medical practitioners such as dentists take a number of hours of professional development every month. This is often in the form of courses that can range from anywhere between three days and a year. The prices can also range from £300-several thousand pounds. Currently, there is no transparency on these courses which are run by dental centres all around the country, and most course decisions are made on the basis of personal referrals and word of mouth. It's therefore difficult for a dentist to decide why one course might be better than the same course being run at another dental surgery. With WordofMouth an online platform will enable users to post their reviews of the courses they have been on and read reviews on other courses.	2019-09-10 17:02:57.895777
1829	/startup-idea/force-fields	As of now, we are currently focused on using  ABM's (Anti Ballistic Missiles) to protect our citizens, cities, etc against such threats from state and non state actors. While the use of lasers  to destroy missiles has been documented, their use has been restricted to platforms on planes, trucks, and such. The idea of "force fields" are not new but using lasers  by bending them to form a  shape could, theoretically be  used to defend cities and large populations.  In 2009, scientists were able to bend lasers.  Try bending it into a concave/bowl shape and  maintain such a field for a significant amount of time, would be key	2019-09-10 17:02:57.895777

This one is inspired by the automated telephone newsletter for those who haven’t got internet but need it (http://www.forbes.com/sites/eliportnoy/2012/03/15/how-to-find-a-great-start-up-idea/ ) and the fast development of text to voice apps. \nThe Offline Hotline would simply connect you to a speech app with which you could search the internet. You could find out all you need, whether its the bus timetable, a fact or the birthday of your flatmate, if its on Facebook. Additionally you could be connected to a real person for advanced searches. For those permanently without internet, newsletters could be sent to the phone, or even disaster warning messages and all the internet knows before you.	2019-09-10 17:02:57.895777

Lots of people have too much stuff and others have lots of space which they would like to get paid for. Everyone could offer his free space in the network, be it a cellar an attic, a chamber or a whole hall. People could agree on a price for it, a duration, have it send there or bring it there. The site would get a provision. Legally the owner would state that all in the box is legal, the storer would guarantee unopened and secure storing.

1835	/startup-idea/cake-and-coffee-user-friendly-elder-network	As society ages more and more and people get ever more isolated, especially the older they get, here might be a solution. Cake and Coffee would be a network for old people to plan events, beginning from something as casual as Cake and Coffee or a walk together. Being mostly for digital natives, the network would offer an automated phone handling. Customers could set a newsletter via telephone to get notified when something is up in their vicinity, or start projects themselves. This could work like crowdfunding: Cake and coffee if minimum 4 people join. Furthermore the network could provide services from a hotline with personal help delivering all the internet can: Organizing transport, shopping etc, and so functioning as an opening window to the digital world and a bridge to the social one. Revenue could come in via ads, a small fee after the first month, the personal hotline costing a fee, or via provisions from the extra services like transport or shopping, taken from the companies to whom the order is passed on. \n\n	2019-09-10 17:02:57.895777

This would be a network for real people who live real lives and do not waste money frivolously.  Something like the opposite of the uber-pretentious http://asmallworld.com.  A network in which to interact with other "working joes," and those who share value - not boasts.	2019-09-10 17:02:58.965599

I think most of people can afford 1-2 euro/usd per month to help planet, children and so on. And donation for this organizations must be as easy as possible. And I suggest integrating sms payment service for such organizations. We build web site, contact legally registered social organizations about their needs. We promote this with the help of social networks. Social organizations get their money. Once web site is built it costs nothing to run this project. So this project is only for volunteers. I will build web site. I need people who can promote it. Any other ideas regarding this project are welcome.	2019-09-10 17:02:58.965599
1843	/startup-idea/tiser	A social network, similar to 9GAG or so, where a business (local or online) sets-up a profile to which they post their own advertisements. The adverts can be text, images or video. The adverts are then ranked according to most "up votes" and most viewed. This way, the business can see if their advert is effective and if people like it or not.\n\nBoth the most viewed advert and the most up voted advert of each month would receive for example a $50 Adwords voucher to then run their campaign. This way they are incentivised to attract users to the site to vote for and view their advert.\n\nI think this would primarily work because it would be one of the best and biggest methods of FREE advertising for a business.	2019-09-10 17:02:58.965599

Each volunteer account will have a history of transactions,  detailing the activity performed, possibly with pictures and videos.\n\nWhat could the volunteers do with the credits?\n\nVolunteers balance could be used to indicate the level of their commitment to volunteerism, so they can use it in their CVs, etc.\n\nAlso, volunteers could initiate volunteering activities, like cleaning-up a public place and offer their credits in exchange. The more credit a volunteer has give credence to their plight and make people take them more seriously when initiating such activities.\n\nTo minimize fake transaction, all credit issuing organizations will be required to record activities that were performed for the credits to be issued. The log should be reasonably verifiable.\n\nWhen an individual transfers credits, he must detail the activities performed, and at least one reputable/verified local organization on ground will verify that the activity took place as described.	2019-09-10 17:02:58.965599

So we have a series of "Give Cards", instead of "Gift Cards" they are sold from gas stations, convenience stores, music stores etc, people can purchase a pre-determined "give card" like 5,10, 20 $ etc and then they go online and plug in there Give Card Number and pick the charity they want to give to, this gives anyone the ability to give and help the world.	2019-09-10 17:02:58.965599

We have the 4th most sunny days on average compared to other states but we're also the second largest state in terms of land area (and population as well).  Already, Texas produces more wind energy than another other state, why not solar?\n\nTexas produces more oil than other OPEC countries, but most of that oil is going towards the energy sector when they could easily be used to create more medicine and other products that don't harm the environment to the same degree.  We need to urge the energy lobby to switch to renewable sources of energy, the wind will never run out (especially here in Texas) and the sun will always shine!  We'll be doing good for the planet and for the economy.  As the energy sector accepts renewable energy sources, improvements in harvesting the sun, as well as the wind, will help increase profits in the long run!\n\nIt's profitable, sensible, and necessary!

One such gap, that can be discussed here is dependence of airline pilots on air traffic controllers. Most pilots use what are airways (much highways) to reach their destination along with help from ATC. How about a refined or a re-defined version of the Glasses that allows the pilot to ascend, descend or approach on their with ATC as a stand by measure. The glasses will have pre-determined flight patterns configured into them before the flight. The pilot will be able to see current altitude, when to drop or gain altitude and nearest flight location. Also, a blinking measuring system can be used to determine if the pilot is too tired and/or should he put the plane on autopilot or relinquish control to the co-pilot. There can be further enhancement to improve flight safety as well as flying control from operational end.	2019-09-10 17:02:59.940902
1852	/startup-idea/fast-free-universal-wiki-with-eg-1-billion-users	Problem: All multi-user wikis are server based (i.e.: bottleneck; slow) & therefore are costly to setup or to subscribe to, & don't scale to many users.\n\nSolution? Implement the wiki 99% browser-side using pure javascript; therefore no costly servers. So where do pages gets stored? Users login via e.g. Google account & store pages via e.g. Google Drive API (via client javascript). Upon edit an updated page copy is created on their e.g. Google Drive. How to lock pages during editing? A light-weight messaging service (the 1% outside the browser) something like e.g. http://www.pubnub.com/ would broker requests & also store the latest location of every wiki page. How can the universal wiki scale to e.g. one billion users? Storage is handled by freely available online storage already used by one billion users. Think of the light-weight messaging as what DNS is to web servers; very light-weight, cheap to run, and scalable. Why would the universal wiki be faster? Because there is no web server bottleneck; all wiki processing is done locally in the browser; one billion users is like have one billion CPUs :-P\n\nRevenue?

Then, if you don't have all the ingredients you might need, it will generate a grocery list to your predetermined favorite place to shop, and alert you via GPS when you are at the store, so you don't forget the list.

1875	/startup-idea/find-your-sport-buddy	First of all, my idea and analysis is more focused on Germany.\n\nSport is one of the most important activities that people are keen on, almost everyone is doing sport, most of the sports need partner,  one famous example is Jogging, which usually is better with partner to keep the commitment to the sport and kill any laziness, there are more other examples.\nBut how to find a Sport Buddy  ? ask yourself first\nAnswers ??\nCouchsurfing or Facbook groups.\nFirst question,  Were those platforms  really made for that ?\nSecond question, What if you find a buddy, how to maintain that, i mean, how to agree on regular dynamic meetings, say hey tomorrow i don't have time, let's shift it to Monday, will you have to write SMS or Whatsapp msg for that.\n\nThen definitely we need a new platform that is sport oriented, tailored for that very purpose, there are some platforms, but again, they just imitate the current social network platforms, we need our platform to be really made for sport which will make it more efficient that all the current inefficient solutions.\n\nI have the idea with concur concept design in mind for one year now, but i need someone to encourage me and start implementing it.\n	2019-09-10 17:03:03.084931
1876	/startup-idea/golf-app-with-eco-system	I have been working on Golf Platform including APP and eco-systems. I have post the APP on Google play and Apple store.  The  idea of the platform (we called PGG Game, u can type the name on store to search. web site, www.pgggame.com).  Since playing golfing, u have to coordinate team member when and where we are going to have monthly event, it is kind of hard for admin to coordinate without a good system. After golfing, admin have to input score for ranking, usually, only type out and in score, without each hole score.  That is quite hard for admin for ranking, espeically, if something, the admin have to re-ranking again. After golf monthly event, actually, each member did not get something left. With PGG Game APP, each member can have detail score info. and your group member and scoring, team ranking ,... a lot of info. golfer can keep for memory.  The major model is we are creating new gaming for golfer we called "PK voting match", from the PK voting system we can get cash flow and members can go m-commerce to consume pgg game points.  We are at the stage for more expansion and opportunity. Any one is interesting for global golf game platform ( Offline to Onlne)?	2019-09-10 17:03:03.084931

New security risks would come with this type of invention, but the risk of losing your credit card is almost impossible, unless of course you loose your phone, in which case you can make it so only your finger prints can access the card.

If someone does something better than me, I try to do something even better. There could be sponsors of certain competitions e.g. Who can eat a box of Oreos the most creative way? Who can use the ShamWow to clean the dirtiest thing? People can create their own categories and monetize their videos/category with ads like YouTube. \nOr the site could set up prizes from its own profits.\nIt could potentially be made into a TV show like Ridiculousness and American Idol rolled into one: live audiences plus viewers voting on winners as they watch internet videos.	2019-09-10 17:03:04.102424

I have written a book and have the solution. I need an app developer and marketer who want to passionately help others succeed but understand their payoff does not come until we see results. That is why I am looking for people who want to make a difference for families. people who understand the pain of being locked in a 9-5, trying to start a biz on the side to escape that 9-5 but meet failure at every turn because they do not know who to reach out to for help.

1910	/startup-idea/microbots-from-big-hero-six	A microbot is a little sphere with two cones attached at opposite ends, allowing it to rotate or bend like an elbow.\n A microbot connects to another microbot, which connects to another microbot  through the power of electromagnetism at which point microbots move by passing each other along a chain of microbots. It’s hard to picture without just seeing it in action, but imagine a chain of these little structures stretching from right to left.  And every time, bots extend from the chain to catch the traveling one. This continues on until the one on the very right has migrated all the way across the chain. When they move millions of bots are passing themselves along in the same fashion. Even though in the movie a neural transmitter was used to control the bots, in rel time we can build a simple application that can feed pictures to the bots. Such bots would have wast scope in construction, transpiration, creating and destroying stuck in seconds.\n\n\n\n\nRead more at Film School Rejects: http://filmschoolrejects.com/features/big-hero-6-robots.php#ixzz3Ijks0FpO\nRead more at http://filmschoolrejects.com/features/big-hero-6-robots.php#sUqXGfBDe2S0GoPO.99	2019-09-10 17:03:06.795439

1915	/startup-idea/biosteel-or-biomaterials	Looking at biological cells, we can manipulate its functions to build and replace earth's limited minerals and resources.\n\nThere are two plans for this:\n\nA) either allow cells to make micro-parts of materials on their own (through what is called an enzyme that perform chemical functions)\n\nor\n\nB) basically put cells together into organs and those organs will have different qualities such as durability, flammability, flexibility, colours, etc, which will give rise to potentially different materials from wood, aluminum, steel.\n\nBenefits & Advantages:\n\n1. Environment friendly- allow cells to degrade itself later on, which is easier and faster than chemical compounds to degrade\n\n2. Potentially infinite (?) resource- cells divide and proliferate on their own. If we make one cell that has a similar function like steel, than we can just allow itself to divide and create 2,4,8,16,... million cells that function like steel, by only giving basic nutrients such as sugar, water, and amino acids (proteins)\n\n	2019-09-10 17:03:06.795439

One example would be identifying the owner accurately through their senses so that the owner does not need to worry anything about getting their private information stolen, when someone tries to access unwanted information\n	2019-09-10 17:03:06.795439

Our personal voice connection would not mute the music, simply lower the volume a bit while the other person is talking similar to how maps plays audio turn by turn directions.<br><br>This could also be used on a Bus, Subway, or Airplane where many people use headphones to pass the time an reduce the background noise.  You might also be sitting a few rows away from your friend or partner and could still chat with one another.	2019-09-10 17:03:07.731454

Lets say your at a festival and you have to search around just so you can charge your phone... well with the solar power phone charge you could be in the comfort of your tent and simply pitch in the ground outside your tent and the nature do the rest. \nHere another one maybe your at just at the pub with you friends chatting and facebooking away and you see the 10% battery icon, annoying right? and its only 2pm. i would design a iPhone/android case just like the external battery but  with a sheet of solar panel to keep the case charging. this case would have a on/off button for the panels. this could also help save lives of travellers, hikers, etc. because this is away of helping of getting back communication with the world if your in trouble or in other cases you use your phone to much like me.	2019-09-10 17:03:07.731454
1924	/startup-idea/forum-software-where-user-has-more-rights	Most forum software let's anyone comment on your threads, even if you don't like them to. A solution would be to develop forum software where threads are the private space of the OP and can be seen only by those he deems worthy and if in the case the user decides to allow everyone to see it or post in it, he can delete any post he doesn't like from since his thread is his space.\n\nCurrently this functionality can only be done by forum admins or moderators, but I am proposing to allow this liberty to everyone.

1932	/startup-idea/computers-part-online-shopping-website-in-india-	Hey everyone out there, \nI recently had an Idea to make an e-Commerce website for India that would just specifically focus on selling computer's part and computer related parts at a very good price that you would expect at a retail store. Right now, we have websites like, Flipkart.com , snapdeal.com , amazon.in and many others but none of theme specifically focus on Computer related stuff. They don't have a variety of things and most of the stuff is overpriced and in India we have many Tech Enthusiasts who want to buy Tech Stuff(computers part) at home with the ease of a click of a button, instead of going out in market wasting car fuel, time and money. So what do you think guys ? I have many plans but would not disclose all right now. This is the general basic Idea. I have lot of features and stuff to add in there. Please let me know your views on this Problem, many tech enthusiasts face and do you like my solution to it ?	2019-09-10 17:03:07.731454
1933	/startup-idea/web-20-pet	A digital pet that will accompany you while you browsing the web, providing you with useful tools like searching information and content or chat with friends who also have this pet and many more, all in a way that will make the whole browsing experience more fun and enjoyable. So in order to do all that this pet will have the unique characteristic of constantly learning and adapting with the web 2.0 principal of collective intelligence. Similar to the idea of wikis (like Wikipedia) were they becoming more and more powerful and useful as more users interact with them, this pet will also become more useful and relevant as the users “teaching” him new tricks. So for example you can ask direct questions to the pet like what is the best site for creating startup ideas? The pet will then respond depending on what is has learned so far from its users. For example it can give an immediate and quick answer or tell you  story or give you a direct link to the page or show you a video or maybe even do a trick for you xD	2019-09-10 17:03:07.731454

1937	/startup-idea/personal-black-box	We have smart phones that can record everything, but when emergency situation happens, we most often don't have time to react and hit the record button. In cases of mobbing, blackmailing or if you need an emergency response it would even be dangerous. So in the end we don't record anything.\nMy idea is an application that would work like airplane's black box. \nAlways record the last hour or how the user permits the use of memory.\nIf we want to have a longer history of recording can lease Claude services.\nIn the settings can be options like: record only sound, picture and sound, motions, speed,…etc\n\n Of course, the application must be on in order to work and  it has to be able to activate itself automatically if you leave a certain position or come to a certain position , or if it exceeds a set speed of movement , etc .  It would all be listed in  settings manual.\n\nIt could storage everything on Internet, like Cloud system. So if anything happens to you that would make you lose your smart phone, you could look it up in Internet account afterwards.\n	2019-09-10 17:03:08.744433

1945	/startup-idea/forced-language-study	Hello creative people, \n\nRecently I have come up with an idea to create an app that will make people (studying languages) learn new words every time they unlock their moblie phones. Usually, when I download an app for learning a language, I visit it once or twice and then because of having no time or some other reason I  just forget about it. \nSo I thought what if the app will visit you by itself every time you unlock your phone. It can be a multiple choice, for instance, and if you don't know the right definition and answer it wrong, the app will offer you to ask the same question later, and if you tick it, then next time you unlock the phone, the same question will pop up again and this time you will surely remember the right definition,if not, then do it again.\nMaybe it will be annoying sometimes but who said learning is all about pleasure:))\n\nI just need your opinion about this and will be happy to hear from you:)\n\nSincerely,\nAshot	2019-09-10 17:03:08.744433

A passenger becomes an eye of the police authority, not only he will help the government and save lives, but he might get a percentage of the penalty sum in case the driver over-speed which i think it would help make this system popular to use.	2019-09-10 17:03:09.771949

1964	/startup-idea/platform-to-help-finish-your-project	I'm thinking about creating a website where people would add  projects which they want to create (alone or involving cofounders), they would share how they create features step by step through development, how much is done, business model etc.. They could have feedback from other people while developing the app and stay supported and motivated along the way to finish the project. It could be ones'blog creation, new social network, fixing car etc. Just think of it as a kickstarter without funding, even for smaller project. Just see what others do and show others what you do, partner up and finish what you started. What do you think?	2019-09-10 17:03:10.742222

1975	/startup-idea/share-luggage-allowance-in-airports	Ever had a lot of luggage and travelled with travelers who don't have as much? This is a very early stage idea but the intent is to have other travelers who do not have as much luggage to lend their remaining luggage allowance to other travelers. Not sure what the reward or incentive would be. Also unsure about the kind of security threats it could pose at airports or if people would feel unsafe sharing their allowance. Just wanted to brainstorm the various bugs/issues with this idea and if it could cause more problems than help people.	2019-09-10 17:03:10.742222

When a kid opens a lemonade stand, students organizing car washes, and fisherman selling their catches they are all usually temporary things. I want to build a mobile app that allows both young and old entrepreneurs to list where they are doing business (i.e. where is the lemonade stand located?) and for the public to know about it when they go about their lives.	2019-09-10 17:03:11.734993
1980	/startup-idea/jvme	This is a project I'm working on, it's called JVME.com\n\nWhat we're creating is an idea platform where project can come to life.\nThe problem I see in the market is that many good ideas remain ideas. Many talented people lack the knowledge how to start their project, who to work with, how to fund it all, and how to manage the progress.\nI suggest a social network of entrepreneurs and projects, where you can share you project, recruit co founders  for required positions and share equity for the work done. Inside the project you have access to tools that will help you get your project done, a project management tool, crowd funding platform and affiliate network.\nWe are just getting off the ground, and I would love to hear what everybody thinks about this, what ideas you have to make it better, and if you would like to take part in something like that.\n\nYou can check us out @ www.JVME.com - and register for the beta version when it is complete.	2019-09-10 17:03:11.734993
1981	/startup-idea/share-todos-with-your-family	Living with other people is nice when everyone has chance to do everything. So, everyone will get basic skills in everything. \nHow that works: \nFamily or friends living in the same household log in with google/fb account, make a group, add things to do (with interval or repeating every day/week/month/year, i.e. cleaning, taking trash out, making dinner, mowing, shopping etc) and those will be fairly shared to personal calendars with notifications.

1982	/startup-idea/face-emotion-detector	When someone lies it can be detected by certain changes in his/her expression.

1983	/startup-idea/sim-wifi	What will you do if you have to make an urgent call and you have no currency left in the phone?\nIdea-\nProbably everyone today use smartphones and help each other with internet sharing using WIFI. If it was  possible to share ones phone currency to help the other person, we can handle the above situation easily. It is just similar to WiFi but the benifit is, it will have no restrictions(like your network provider idea, airtel, vodaphone, etc.). Any one can share their balance without hectic transfer of currency in each other's mobile phone.	2019-09-10 17:03:11.734993

In this game TAN one say word like ''hope'' the other team or mate will tell a word starts with letter "e" like "exit". The game will run like this. No repeating is allowed once a word is used it cant be reused. One who has good vocabulary will win the game. No dictionary or electronic gadget allowed. Unusual words can be used but one has to tell its spelling, meaning and correct pronunciation.	2019-09-10 17:03:11.734993

1991	/startup-idea/immuno-surpression-personal-care-line	It would be a great idea for someone to start a personal care brand designed for people with suppressed immune systems. It could include extra parabens (the most effective preservative). It should not have plant extracts because some people may be sensitive and take every consideration as to the needs of people with suppressed immune function. This could be a major hit as many people experience this from common chemo treatment and anti-inflammatories. Some companies use special bottle caps to minimize bacteria, air and dirt getting into the product as well. There are some containers which do not allow air into the product at all.	2019-09-10 17:03:12.750946
1992	/startup-idea/shark-tank-online	That would be a platform with two different types of users, entrepreneurs and investors.\nEntrepreneurs would only pay to post a project with different plans and can select what type of investment want (risk capital, seed capital, society, loan, etc).\nInvestors would pay to register and would have plans for a monthly pay or lifetime pay, they could see all the projects registered on the platform, and see for each project detailed information about the project and the entrepreneur. He could also contact the entrepreneur for more information and would have acces to the project's offers and add his own offer if he is interested in the project.\nThe platform would be closed to unregistered users, like a landing page where th unrigistered users could see information about the platform and the benefits of registration as entrepreneur and investor, and there would be registration and login forms.\nThe platform would also have a internal message and notification system.\nI can develop a part of the platform, I have some doubts about implementing payment system and find a cheap solution to host a platform like this for the first months after launch the platform to the air.	2019-09-10 17:03:12.750946
1993	/startup-idea/speed-dating	A social media dating app that works on an area basis, the idea is it works like a standard dating app, where you can meet and talk to people across the country, each week the app send an invite for a speed dating/singles night. Depending on the number or positive replies this can then be sent to local venues who can organise the event with a confidence ofa positive turnout, companies can be added to this at a small fee which is where the app would make it's money, if we make it a free service, however add an upgraded version for a fee this could be a real money maker	2019-09-10 17:03:12.750946

Also, i do not want people to put multiple rating. They can put one and can change it after 2 weeks.<br><br>This resolves people going to different sites / apps to search / put the ratings and you get correct ratings with no lengthy comments  as one / person is allowed only to rate.	2019-09-10 17:03:12.750946

1996	/startup-idea/digital-photoframe-for-cloud-services	It looks like there is no digital photo frames that supports icloud services. To make it more mainstream friendly support for other cloud services would be great. Like OneDrive, Dropbox. Flickr, Instagram etc.<br>The photo frame must be thin, wall mountable and come is vary sizes. It would be nice if you could smart connect 3 screens to have a cool looking 3 frame photo (one photo divided on 3 screens).<br>The picture frame should have a motion sensor and timer. For example, when someone walks in the room, the screen would turn on and display for 10-60 minutes. Ambient sensor would also be recommended. So at night screen is not as bright as it is on a sunny day.<br>Screen should support touch with some simple features like swipe for next and previous pic. Double tap to freeze current picture for 12 hours. Double tap again to continue slideshow.<br>Screen should have a smallest possible frame. Just enough frame to snap-on a custom picture frame if user would like to do so. Alternative, there could be a picture frame built in the software slideshow.<br>All settings should be changed from your mobile phone.<br>The power supply must be small and easy to hide.	2019-09-10 17:03:12.750946

Here's the solution and it stops those greedy exchange guys getting there slice of our money - \nletsxchange is an app similar in concept to Uber. Once registered you can 'request' a search for someone, like you, who wants to exchange currency. \nHere's an example of how it can work - you are at the airport waiting to fly home. You have $300 left and you use your letsxchange app. Someone in the airport is looking for dollars and gets your request. You meet up and swap money. \n	2019-09-10 17:03:12.750946
1998	/startup-idea/job-application-screening-evaluation	Most of the HR manually check the resume of the applicant or maybe call for interview. My idea is for screening evaluation, applicant will sent their resume and the apps/system will first evaluate the applicant based on the hiring position and qualification. It will be base on the experience and skills of the applicant.	2019-09-10 17:03:12.750946
1999	/startup-idea/wait-less	So you know how there is an app for planes at the airport where it tells you what time they arrive, if they are delayed or on schedule etc... What if there was an app for doctors or dentists etc that told you if they were running on time? As you always get there on time and end up waiting for ages etc, what if you could login from home before you left and saw that they are 20 mins behind schedule etc... People would be so happy and it would save everyone so much time in waiting and also mean waiting rooms aren't crowed.	2019-09-10 17:03:12.750946
2000	/startup-idea/qas-freelancing-site	I thinking about building freelancing web service just for testers. My approach is little different then standard freelancing web services.

So we go online, select our favorite dish from our favorite restaurant  and have them delivered at our door steps, in minutes. We appreciate the chef who cooked and the quality of the restaurant.

2002	/startup-idea/online-watch-up	I know what you're thinking, I'm mad. There are 100's. However being a student I always find myself in the middle, I am either looking at products far too expensive for the type of quality I want or the type of price I want to pay for the quality I do not wish to accept. \n\nBeing a student this is one of the most annoying things going, and I believe although very competitive there is a gap in the market for a luxury watch built for students, or targeted market of 16-26 year olds. \n\nAt this age most people have no idea on careers, although they like to look smart, and dress well. Well here comes my idea. Building a watch to fit the needs of those people, at the price those people want to pay. \n\nI am also looking to do this with another person, if interested please email me at alextquinney@gmail.com and we can start working on this as soon as possible.	2019-09-10 17:03:12.750946

2004	/startup-idea/multi-media-collaboration-tool-for-team	Managing distributed work force is no easy task so I thought  every kind of team communication has to be shared and archived in one place including chat, e-mail, video conferencing(WebRTC), phone call and even text message.\nImagine if you were walking down the street and hit on a new great idea for your team project on a sudden, you can share it just by texting, phone call, voice recording and choose the channel to upload...	2019-09-10 17:03:13.868205

What are your thoughts about this idea folks .\n	2019-09-10 17:03:13.868205
2006	/startup-idea/clipboard-	Its 2015 and you can only have one item in the clipboard on your computer/phone. I would like to see an app that replaces the stock clipboard system where you can store infinite, if not at least 5 separate items that you copied on to the clipboard. Whenever you want to paste, it will show you the list of items that you copied previously. Perhaps an overlay that slowly fades into view right next to the place you want to paste. The app can even have advanced options for customizability like being able to highlight words and characters within an item and copy that as a separate item in the clipboard. A built in search function would be helpful to filter through the list. It would be ideal for this app to act like the stock clipboard service and work silently in the background. This app would be totally free with no in-app purchases or ads. Super-light download and install if possible.\nP.S. Material design on android platforms is a necessity	2019-09-10 17:03:13.868205
2007	/startup-idea/never-fill-forms-again-in-your-life	We fill forms everyday. Be it applying for a job, a visa, a loan, drivers licence etc. 90% of the time we are regurgitating the same information, repeating it every time we are met with such tasks. How about a service that pulls this data from one location. We always update our details on the site and every other organisation or website that needs certain details can use this data when we allow it to. Social network sites like Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin etc already share user information this way with other sites but they only share the information they need have about you.  If you are reading this and have a tech background, you might have guessed that i'm looking for better ways to use the OAuth protocol other than what we are currently doing with it.	2019-09-10 17:03:13.868205

2087	/startup-idea/gardening-platform-through-online-app	Now a days cutting of deforestation is more than growing plants for a development of city many.Plants and tress are sacrificed and only few have patience and Concern to replant,So if there is a online platform in the form of app to plantation where people can adopt plants by paying little amount there would be an business also and greenery everywhere.	2019-09-10 17:03:24.494858
2009	/startup-idea/grocery-network	PROBLEM:\nMany Grocery Online now dominated by Multinational Corporation alone, in addition they also make their own applications. So to compare the prices you have to install multiple apps.\nI often forgot to buy certain ingredients because of forgetting to include it in the shopping list.\nSOLUTION:\nCreate a system Web & Apps Grocery Network which can connect all your nearest grocery store. If we can connect all the grocery store in the future so we also could coordinate the delivery orders from multiple stores at once.\nIn addition we can also add features recipes for every user account, which can be exchanged, trade or share recipes with other users. So if the user plan to make a dish from a recipe, then the system will automatically insert any ingredients required in accordance with the composition of the recipe on the shopping cart. This system will prevent the user forgot to buy certain ingredients of the dishes that he plan to make.\nContact me if you are interested, many of the concepts and additional features that I can not explain here.	2019-09-10 17:03:13.868205
2010	/startup-idea/a-your-choice-of-charity-business	I've always loved companies that donate a percentage of profit to charities, but the problem I run into is that they donate only to a single charity of their choosing. What I would love to do is create a product that donates a certain percentage of the profit to a charity of the customer's choice! They can have three options, and then a fourth that is random choice! My business idea is to make and sell tie dye and screen printed shirts with the idea of 'Your Choice of Charity' implemented into the business. Is this something you think people would be interested in? Any questions or concerns, advice, critism, etc is highly appreciated. Thank you!!	2019-09-10 17:03:13.868205
2011	/startup-idea/method-of-energy-storage-and-power-generation	The present invention is a method of storing hydro-energy combining with floating body to generate extra power. Therefore, an increased total power output, rather than the one only by the application of pumped hydro-power, could be produced, which means short pay-back period and more profits. It could works either as a partner of existing system or a independent unit to increase the reliability of the whole power generation system. \nIt works well as weather-proof solutions where there is seasonal water flow shortage or during drought disaster. Moreover, it could be a robust backup during routine maintenances or malfunction of existing system. \nThis robust system could be built on the places where there are liquid flow available and elevation differences preferred.\n	2019-09-10 17:03:13.868205

2013	/startup-idea/site-to-review-college-advisors	Students who are in college often will meet with a college advisor. Sometimes, if the advisor is bad, they will not give the student good advice. My idea is to make a website where students can post reviews about advisers for future students.\nI was originally working on this project, I still am, but I am myself a full-time college student therefore I do not have much time to work on it.	2019-09-10 17:03:13.868205
2014	/startup-idea/inner-world	People are  lazy to make a commitment to solve their inner problems and work on their self improvment. Even if they get some desire, they rather choose to look for quick fix rather than try to make some comprehensive approach to their problem, especially if it is about something that is not apparent at first glance. For example, someone can have a desire to have a long term relationship, but still be constantly failing to get some, and actually without being able to recognize underlying patterns that keep him back.\nMy idea to help solving this kind of a problems is to make an app that will teach this stuff by giving lessons periodically, always at the same time of a week. For example, user chooses that he wants lessons on romantic relationships two times a week, let's say on Monday and Wednesday at 20 p.m, for period of 60 days. App should raise alarm and take user to website where his lesson is located.. These lessons  would be articles or blogs carefully choosen by developers. There would be a few areas like romantic relationships, friendships,  and possibly spirituality and maybe something else.	2019-09-10 17:03:13.868205

2017	/startup-idea/time-travel-computer-version	Are you tired of this "Dude!!! you clicked on the wrong thing!!" in the messenger's bag? well this is my idea, TimeTravel.exe\nIt is a app that allows you to time travel, say you was goofing off, and you needed work done, after you goof off, you can right click the paper icon in the system tray, click on go back, type in a time you want to go back, then a new cursor appears, doing the same things you was doing, then the "other" cursor (you from the future) does everything for the goofer (You from the past), the files will be saved, and when you right click the paper icon again there's a new button "Go Back" One click and you're back to your normal time, with the files from the past you made saved into the normal time period, Sounds good right? well how about 3 cursors, you do 3 seconds of random cursor movement, go back 5 seconds, second cursor appears, you do more random cursor movement with you from the past, then you Go back 5 seconds once again, a second and third cursor appears, you do more random cursor movement with you from 10 seconds past, and you from 5 seconds past! Sounds Awesome? Right?	2019-09-10 17:03:13.868205

2021	/startup-idea/airbnbuber-for-freelancer-programmer-designer	For Freelancer/Programmer/Designer, it's difficult to seek a reasonable working place with wifi and power supply other than cafes(almost starbucks) or co-working space.\n\nCafe is sometimes crowded and hard to work longer. Co-working space's daily use plan is expensive. After hovering, at last, being disappointed, taking a seat at Starbucks is SUCKS!\n\nSo my solution is a platform between whose want to use a short-time working space and whose want to rend their space.	2019-09-10 17:03:14.773893

It will have a few filters so activities wil only be displayed to relevant people.	2019-09-10 17:03:14.773893
2023	/startup-idea/brainstorm-university	Job seeking students want to distinguish themselves, build their CV and establish an early relationship with the companies they would like to work for. There are lots of students, many of which have time, sharp skills and creative brains.\n\nCompanies are busy, bureaucratic and under resourced. 'Blue sky' thinking can be risky. To me this seems like a natural marketplace: there's a huge pool of labour willing to work in return for an increased chance of a job in future.\n\nCompanies post jobs, students submit their work, companies get to pick from a pool of ideas and issue prizes to the best (such as work experience, fast tracking, CV recognition). The problems could be on anything from code, journalism, design or research.	2019-09-10 17:03:14.773893

During this sale time, thier content is displayed on a a huge live app/website showing current products for sale and the customers can click on thier product and head to thier store to purchase or simply view other products for sale, thier would also be a search feature for the customers to search items and deals and be lead to what they were looking for.	2019-09-10 17:03:14.773893

In one house children might be studying, in another, there is a celebration for getting a new job. Pest Control at one place and asthma patient next door. Celebration of one religion/ethnicity, mourning of the other. This app will allow to post "quiet day" and "noisy day" demands, "work-in-progress" vs. "patient onboard" demands for all the residents in a particular geo-cluster and allow each of them to plan and act considering the other's needs. This already happens face-to-face but can also happen in the virtual world.	2019-09-10 17:03:14.773893

All had to be evenly spaced horizontally and vertically. I do something similar several times a year. What I want is a simplified design program that will evenly distribute any sizes of rectangles similar to this, and give me all needed measurements to locate where I need to put the nails or screws. It should not be a bloated CAD or drawing program that tries to do everything and takes weeks to learn. Ideally, all features of the program should be learnable in less than 10 minutes.

2039	/startup-idea/crowdfunded-lobbyists	Everyone knows that modern governments are bought & paid for by special interests. Our elected officials don't even pretend to represent the people anymore (once they're in office... they will profess to having your best interests at heart til they're blue in the face while they're campaigning), they're all beholden to the financeers of their campaign and when important legislation comes up on the docket for a vote, the armies of corporate lobbyists always have their ear while the general public has no real voice on these issues at all. But...what we if we too had the ability to hire these all powerful Lobbyist groups to work for us, the American people? Might our state & federal officials finally become compelled to listen to the will of their respective constituencies?  With the advent of 'crowd-funding,' we now have an opportunity to find out.

So most of them pay by cash.\n\nTo solve this problem, I have an idea of developing a mobile application that will store your ATM cards as fingerprints. So you can pay by your Finger Print. So no need of ATM cards. \n\nWhy this idea now?\nSimple. From the middle of last year, many mobile companies are releasing the mobile that has finger print sensor. So by the end there will lot of mobile with finger print sensors. This is the right time to develop this idea.	2019-09-10 17:03:15.83291

He thinks he can do it only with Photoshop. But, I know there is an online service, which is easier. He doesn't know what to search for it, in google.

The app will bring up all the flight tickets that are available that fits to the amount entered by the user.\nEx: I am from Brazil and would like to visit Florida, USA, but user only can spend $ 500 on a flight ticket. The user would need to schedule the time of period that they are want to travel, maybe from March thru June, and the app would show, daily, a report with all the flight tickets available that fit to the amount of $ 500, it could be up to $ 550.	2019-09-10 17:03:17.254901
2049	/startup-idea/scheduling-for-the-digital-age	Time and time again, I see paper schedules being posted in all types of business environments from fast food to retail to financial institutions.  With mobile/web becoming the dominant means for communication, schedules should move that way as well.  There are millions of employees who have to write down their schedule on a napkin, take a picture on their phone, etc. just to remember when they need to be at work.  Lets build a web and mobile app that allows:\n\n-Mobile notification when new schedule is posted or schedule is changed\n-Claiming of open shifts by employees\n-Tools to help managers see their employees requested hours when creating the schedule\n-Reminders when a shift is coming up to help keep employees from showing up late or not at all\n-Plus many more features!\n\nI have experience with the SQL Server Stack, Excel, Access, and some basic C#.

So that messages can be displayed like this:\nhttps://youtu.be/HE_Jn2N3ty0?t=52s\n\nThe app will determine a phone's location in the stadium using GPS and assign it a fixed position like a pixel in a screen. \n\nPeople will face the screen of the phone while the flash faces towards the ground. At any time 3 suggestions can be shown on the screen. For example let's take a Cricket match, three marquee message options would be 1) "India India" 2) "KOHLI" 3) "SIX". People can press the buttons and crowd vote in real time and whichever option gets the most votes will be displayed. Users can even type in suggestions and whichever suggestion gets most votes will become part of the 3 options.	2019-09-10 17:03:17.254901

2062	/startup-idea/music-club	Musical instruments are expensive and demand a lot of time, effort and skill to take care of. Recording devices are expensive too. I suggest to open a place where such things can be rented for a short period of time (0 to 5 hours), for use in nearby soundproof rooms, so that several bands can record themselves simultaneously without annoying one another. This would allow customers to discover and learn playing new instruments without buying them nor having to maintain them (employees would be the ones taking care of the instruments after sessions). This also ensures to customers that instruments are maintained by expert hands.<br>For a freer ambience, I suggest allowing customers to play in the reception room.<br>This needs not be the sole activity of the store: it can also sell instruments or music-related items, and offer maintenance services for the customers' own instruments.	2019-09-10 17:03:20.902882

Because they are more or less wealthy, or simply because the product is more valuable to them subjectively. \nWhen you put a product for sale on the internet, you don't know how much people are willing to pay for it and therefore you may be losing money.

2113	/startup-idea/collaborative-writing-social-network	A scenario has several layers of abstraction. Some writers may work on a more abstract level, design the general architecture of a plot, other writers may flesh the plot out.<br>Little by little, the work becomes less and less abstract, more and more alive.<br>A writer delineates the big parts of the story. Another writer chooses one part among these, and delineates its big subparts. The process is repeated with the subparts, until an agreement is reached that a big part is completed. A completed part is then locked against further edits, though branching is allowed (the creation of a completely unlocked new project based on a copy of the current project).<br>If the whole story is deemed complete, it may be locked too. While the story is still unlocked, new big parts may be added, so that the story can run indefinitely long.<br>Dialogues may be written cooperatively too, for example with each writer making the lines of a single character, so that a vivid contrast in personality appears between the characters.<br>It is important not to enforce policies on how writers should coordinate their effort, so that experimentation leads to new ways to work together.	2019-09-10 17:03:26.918657

Also, the nicotine tablet would help curb the addiction.	2019-09-10 17:03:28.561866
2114	/startup-idea/trainer-connection---connection-fitness-to-you	PROBLEM: \nFor people who are just being introduced to fitness, it can be a pain to figure out where to start. Do I just find something on the internet and try it? Do I just hire a personal trainer? Do I just get a membership and learn from watching other people? There are so many questions that run through a persons’ mind when they're trying to figure out how to approach fitness. It only takes ONE bad experience to ruin fitness for a person. \nSOLUTION:\nAn app. Not just any app, but Trainer Connection. This app will allow people to find the gyms and fitness centers closest to their location via phone GPS. It is essentially a social app for Certified Personal Trainers and customers. Trainers can share videos, exercises, articles, recipes, and more not only to other trainers but also to the customer. Users who are looking for a trainer can make it public on the app and trainers can reach out to the customer or vice versa. Trainers can also allow reviews. Trainers can post available schedules and users can see when the trainer is free. Users can earn rewards points after every verified personal training session. Thus creating an incentive for people to continue their fitness goals. \n	2019-09-10 17:03:26.918657

But they don't like to sell the lands even.\nSo people who are willing to do plantation can register in the system and the land owners also can register in the system.\nFrom a legal documentation they are agreeing to do the plantation and the plantation is fully owned by the planter.

2152	/startup-idea/social-network-with-value-based-liking-system	Today in social media, young people "like" posts for all the wrong reasons. They pass around "likes" to everyone and everything, making these "likes" essentially an acknowledgement that they saw the post.\n\nI'm proposing a social network that adds value back to the the traditional "like". This would work by assigning a monetary value to different colored stars (stars = likes). \n\nYellow stars - Common (unlimited)\nGreen stars - Uncommon (limited)\nRed stars - Rare (very limited)\nBlue stars - Super rare (extremely limited)\n\nFor the limited stars, you would have to buy them in packs using real money. The user gets unlimited yellow stars for free, hence acting as a traditional "like" for those users that are too cheap to pay.\n\nThe late Flipnote Hatena service by Nintendo implemented a system like this in the application.\n\nWhen a user receives a tiered star on their post, they receive a percentage of the value of that star-level. The rest of the money goes to the company.	2019-09-10 17:03:30.939422

2157	/startup-idea/a-social-teach-learn-community	Teaching and learning has evolved from the traditional institutions (schools, gyms and clubs) to purely digital learning experiences (udemy, udacity, skillshare etc). Both have its advantages and disadvantages. \n\nFor traditional learning institutions the biggest advantage is you get high-touch experiences. Learning is faster and personal. The trainer is with you and they see your progress and struggles. However, these institutions are often capital intensive and so therefore the lessons are quite costly. Furthermore, teaching is limited to professional services - there are no opportunities for talented hobbyists who can also teach and probably charge at a lower cost.\n\nOnline learning's big advantages are cost and ubiquity. Because these courses or lessons are done online cost is relatively cheaper and you can learn anywhere, anytime. The learning experience though is very low-touch. You can't ask questions, your teacher can't give you feedback/ tips. The learning curve is tough.  \n\nWhy not combine the best of both worlds? What if there's an online community/marketplace where talented people can connect with people online but teach/share their passion offline (high-touch).	2019-09-10 17:03:30.939422
2158	/startup-idea/1-gram-gold-coin-vending-machine	I hope to make a vending machine that sells 1-gram gold coins. A 1-gram gold coin costs USD40.34 today (26 June). Gold is usually sold in bar which is very expensive (USD1254.57 today!). When it comes to buying gold, people think it needs a lot of money and it requires them to visit a classy jewellry boutique. However I hope to make a vending machine that sells gold in small amount so that it is affordable to most people. The machine will be placed in train stations or shopping malls which are places highly accessible to most people. It will be equipped with electronic payment such as Apply Pay, Alipay, PayPal so that no real cash is needed for the purchase. \nWhy Gold Coins? Well bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum are all digital currencies and their values are jumping up like crazy because people are flocking in for risk hedging. Therefore it can be seen that risk hedging is in very high demand, particularly when most governments keep printing money non-stop. I believe people need to store physically gold as well bit by bit in normal days and in times of financial turmoil or war, people can only turn to gold and rely on gold which will not be hacked unlike digital currencies	2019-09-10 17:03:32.029919

The more positive you think, the meter reading increases. \n•\tAllows you to set and achieve positive goals. \n•\tIdentifies negativity and indicates it.\n•\tMotivates you to stay positive by playing an uplifting video or audio, or displaying positive nuggets and tips. \n•\tAllows you to network with positive groups to share and learn. \n•\tSince your body’s response to emotions differ from person to person, allows you to record a feeling and map an emotion (sad, happy, bored..) to it, next time you exhibit the same conditions it displays the emotion.\n•\tProvides historic data of how you have been feeling for the past week, month or year. \n\nPS: I do not mind if someone takes up this idea and develops it, because I believe this product would be a blessing to our society.	2019-09-10 17:03:33.005155

2177	/startup-idea/better-product-service-reviews	Currently, all customer reviews are very simple - name of the author, date of review, rating, and written review. This is helpful, but it could be much better. The problem with these simple reviews is that you usually don't know anything about the author, their expectations, or their previous experiences. When a 30 year old techy is searching for reviews on a laptop, a review written by a 60 year old mechanic doesn't mean as much as a different 30 year old techy's review. Similarly, a college student's raving review of a luxury hotel is probably less useful to a millionaire than another millionaire's review.

Sounds familiar? Yup, we all  have seen something like this in the Hollywood sci fis. But in reality, how possible is it to see a person through a phone camera and have all his information floating next to his face? \nhint: we all will have to use Bluetooth/same wifi network.\n\nI have not been able to figure out how this idea can be brought in to action.\n\nPlease share your thoughts!\nHumayun	2019-09-10 17:03:34.843748

It's in their interest to help meet the CO2 emissions reduction target. <br><br>Create a business plan to show how the percentage of pollution each year could be reduced. This could also be used in other countries across the world until they turn all vehicles electric. <br><br>Filters should have a set time e.g. 1 month before they need to be changed and recycled, washed of their collection and reused.

2223	/startup-idea/yelp-for-dating	I know great people with horrible dating profiles - and that's why they're still single. Worse, dating sites are based on hopeless shallow factors like your selfie game. Most of us are horrible at marketing ourselves - either way too humble or just plain false advertising.\n\nLike it or hate it - word of mouth is the best indication. I'd never make a purchase without reading the reviews. Tell me she was late, messy but fabulous in bed. Tell me he was hilarious and outgoing but terrible at making decisions. I might be looking for the very qualities you hated. But at least I get an honest review.\n\nPeople warn me that this could get nasty so here's my suggestion: feedback must appear on the commenters' page too. That way you wouldn't want to leave a petty comment, because it would sully your reputation the most.\n\nDating apps like this have existed, like Lulu and Stroovy, but they were exclusively for women to review men. Of course they failed - half the population felt scandalized. But meanwhile women loved it and protested en masse when they were shut down. \n\nBring it back, but for all of us!

2238	/startup-idea/friends-rate-system	Hi to all the inventors out there! \n\nThe idea is to optimise one of the best online inventions from the last year's - the Rating System (1-5 * or 1-5/10 Points).\nThe problem: that sometimes products are just negative rated because people are to stupid to use the product or just expect impossible results and also since companys pay for good comments/rates for them own products or negatives for the competitor the rating system isn't that effective anymore. \n\nThe solution: a community of friends, family, youtuber that you know,... people where you can trust the rating.\nSo that rating system needs to be integrated on all the shops in the end. So you go on a page and you can directly see the average rate of those people you have in your rating system.\n\nWho knows something like that? \nAny adding ideas?\nWho can help to start that project? \n\nDaniel	2019-09-10 17:03:38.347902

We can't service patients at #35-50 per hour if we hire full time Doctors, so viable option is to work with pool of doctors who are willing to help patients in their free time.

The same unit can be converted into Hot Air Blower. The same distribution system for cold air can be utilized for hot air also. The new system can be made run on solar energy which makes hot air ( & also can make hot water if required ) The same should be attached to the mother unit of the present system & so in one system itself u can get both the benefits; which is till date not operative anywhere, as per my knowledge but can actually make a revolution around the world.

2284	/startup-idea/no-war-yogurt---politics-in-product-ads	The idea is to combine Product with a political message. As a fraction of the earnings a a company makes of a product goes into advertising anyway, it might just combine it with a message\nFor example: On every ad for this yoghurt there will be a „End the war Now!“ sign. So by buying it, you support a political standpoint that you think makes society better. Its good for the company as it can sell more products and good for your conscience. An additional argument for companies might be that its something totally new and creative, standing out from the boring lies of normal advertising. So even if seen cynically, its  might become a trend.\nThe problem that some people do not like the message could be solved by have the same yoghurt a few cents cheaper without the message. Or even a version with a „Pro War!“ advertising, if the company can agree on that in terms of public image and mental health.  \n\nThe whole thing could be started as a company specialising in selling normal stuff politically. Or, maybe easier, as a marketing agency, that cooperates with sellers on the market by for example putting political stickers on their products and so financing political ads. \n	2019-09-10 17:03:44.537894

2298	/startup-idea/puppy-training-treats-dispenser	I recently adopted a puppy who is now growing and learning how to be a good dog. I have done a decent amount of research about different training techniques and things that may be useful to train a dog.  I decided to used "positive reinforcement training" which essentially means that we shell reward desired behavior of the puppy so that he repeats that very same behavior in the future. Reinforcers could be treats as long as we remain consistent. It is important to be consistent\nA big portion of dog training occurs outdoors, thus it is really important to remember to bring the rewards when you take your puppy out. I found it  difficult to remember to take the treats with you every time you leave the house; I started putting them in little bags and leaving them in my pockets but that idea is pretty time consuming and isn't as eco-friendly as I'd like it to be. I thought that it would be great to have little, easy-to-use, "green" dog treat dispensers that you could attach to the leash just like popular waste-bags for dogs. \nI did some research online and in pet stores and could not find any product like that.	2019-09-10 17:03:46.056968

However the massive increase in population, urged for the swift to indirect democracy. What we hope to recreate for politics in the UK and Greece is a social media website platform where people can come together to discuss political issues and represent their views. Both the already established legislation and the future proposals will be uploaded onto the website and summarised in a simple and concise way. Users will then be able to simply vote yes or no and then see how other users voted. Users will also be able to suggest edits and amendments to the laws, which other users can upvote/downvote, comment on or suggest edits themselves. The ultimate aim is to get the population interested in and discussing political issues through our website. Users can compare how they voted with how the parties voted, to improve their understanding of which political party best represent them.

The most efficient ovens are when a fan is placed in the middle of the elements and forces air through it so it heats up and cooks etc. When and oven is used the two issues are spare space is a waisted energy and how even the heat is distributed in the cooking area.\nThe idea is to use induction elements and several different zones / sensors to monitor oven temperature which would be controlled by a microprocessor.

2360	/startup-idea/kithandlercom	Kithandler.com (working title)  The basic assumption for this idea  is that groups have different purchasing needs than individuals. However there are surprisingly few e-commerce sites  that cater to the needs of group buying uniforms and gear for sport or leisure like activities (e.g. amateur soccer, bowling, poker team). <br>The process of group buying start with  electing and selecting what design should be opted for, collecting specification on sizes and individual customization  which can partly be solved on social media (but we can do better). The customer also expect some kind of group discount, but very often  needs invest the time to find it. <br>Team also often want to buy  gear related to their activity and share the cost of that. Haven't yet found a websites that offers  "split the bill" function     <br>The solution is  an e-commerce site with a simple layout where you can log on - add you self as a member of your team. Vote between generic design offered. Insert you own personal requirement. Add additional gear (.e.g. soccer balls, poker chips, and etc) and opt to share the cost of that.

2379	/startup-idea/garage-sale-madness-app	1. How often do you find you have several household items that are no longer being used but not worth the effort to place ads in Craigslist. If only there was a local garage sale that you could join to get some return for those items. You do not have enough stuff to justify holding your own yard sale, advertise, and buy signs.  But if you could join with some others, even for a nominal fee, and were provided enough space to display your items, you may be inclined to take action. \n\n2. On the other side of the "yard" you have plenty of items and have a large yard, easily accessible to traffic. But you would draw more people if there was more variety in the items and more items to sell. You may be inclined to offer the unused space to others  to achieve the above objectives and maybe charge $10-20   each for renting  display space.   You would end up with a larger, more interesting garage sale  and make some extra money on the side. (like a mini/neighborhood flea market.)\nThose home owners with great locations could become "professional" garage sale operators and rent space to various vendors or neighbors on a regular basis. \n\nhttp://www.statisticbrain.com/garage-sale-statistics/\n\n	2019-09-10 17:03:51.664608

However, one of the methods to improve an review your games is analysing with your opponent after the game, or maybe with friends or club mates, and unfortunately there's no such an open platform to do so on internet. My idea is to develop a website were people can basically analyse chess on-line (that basically needs of a chessboard where both players can do and undo movements, highlight squares, trace arrows, and ideally have a live microphone or even a webcam.) The key here is to create a free service and use premium accounts to gain some revenue. An additional revenue channel is to attract chess coaches.<br>This idea come in a moment where chess is getting very popular around the world and specially within the educational  sectors.	2019-09-10 17:03:51.664608
2381	/startup-idea/social-chat	The problem is that you cant communicate with people you dont know, if you send a friend request to meet that person the social  network blocks you or your friend request is denIed.\nIf you are from facebook you cant add from other networks to your friends list.\nMy idea is to create a chat with profile where people can add people from other networks into this chat and mix al the social networks feeds in this one when you can see whats happening in every social network with your friends.\nYou profile will be private, but you can meet new people in the chatroom.\n	2019-09-10 17:03:51.664608

We create a platform, an app, for designers to put a template of they work for a particular "day" theme (like star wars or dragon ball) and then let customer choose which one do they want to order in the form of a t-shirt.

2383	/startup-idea/defend-your-cause-make-your-case	A news site that splits news stories based on their ideological bias. The site's users rate each story as right-leaning, left-leaning or centrist. When users comment on a story, they are required to reveal if they are left-leaning, right-leaning or centrist on the issue. So readers can filter stories and or comments based on their bias. There will be a troll hunter button that allows the community to oust trolls pretending to be either unbiased or secretly aligning with a camp they don't actually agree with. \n\nThis concept can be applied to a comment plugin like disqus. So blog owners and news sites can gain statistics on how users are rating their stories on the ideological scale and the ideological spectrum of the comments they receive on their posts.	2019-09-10 17:03:52.659114

2386	/startup-idea/wifi-controlled-register-grille-vent-grate	Problem: Central heating/cooling suffer due to the presence of a single central thermostat. Such heating/cooling systems almost never ensure uniform temperature distribution in the house.\n\nSolution: Do away with the central thermostat, and install WFi connected temperature sensors (shouldn't be too expensive) in each room that matters, plus WiFi-controlled vent grilles/grates (cheapest would be using electromagnetic latches) that close/open when the temperature falls outside of a preset range (range that can be preset individually for each room). The furnace/air conditioner should also be controlled by the central control unit (one's WiFi router could play this role, or a tiny inexpensive, always connected Android box), so as it starts working when at least one vent is open, and stops when all vents are closed.\n\nCaveat: powering this whole ensemble might be a bit of a pain. though I don't foresee any major power consumption issues. Push comes to shove, temperature sensors could be either incorporated into power outlets, or plugged into them.	2019-09-10 17:03:52.659114

2395	/startup-idea/fuel-ready---the-consumer-choice-for-saving-%24%24	It's the afternoon, you're passing a county excited for the first holiday you've had in a while. Outside is a fuel station. The fuel price has increased since yesterday. You glance at the fuel tank and decide to continue the journey; there will be a cheaper station along the way. \nIt's now nightfall, you pass a lot of farm properties but no fuel stations. Alas the fuel tank is almost empty. Luckily you see a station ahead. With relief, you drive into into the station only to see the exorbitant price of fuel. Leaving after such robbery leaves you inappetant, ruining the holiday.\n\nProblem - Interstate holidays require constant rest stops for food and refueling. Currently motorists are unable to find the least expensive fuel stations.\n\nSolution - I propose a real time iOS application that accompanies Google Maps/Apple Maps and indicates the cheapest service station on the route and estimates fuel consumption throughout the journey. We use APIs supplied by consumer pricing groups to access current fuel prices.\n\nCurrent Solutions - GasBuddy and similar are outdated and are inefficient for long distance travel. They are useful and suitable but only for local holidays.	2019-09-10 17:03:52.659114

This app would show you the information formated to the user, not bring you millions of links with pages with that word on it.\n\nI'm willing to start this proyect with people on this website and - maybe- outside of it.

2399	/startup-idea/an-app-harmonizing-with-secondary-school-agendas	As a budding secondary school student I understand that keeping up with secondary school work can be a aggravating and stressful process. So to resolve my problem i have thought of a user friendly application idea mending the elitist attitude to school schedule and high intensity system. For example ,receiving text messages or a notification of some sought: reminding you of the piece of Chemistry homework you have due in tomorrow, or that extra bit of revision you need to do for your maths exam on Monday. Even more it simultaneously can be linked within schools, therefore teachers can set reminders for tasks that need to be completed (rather than inputting the issue itself) The app will include a timetable providing what lesson you have when and where whilst maintaining an up to date news section, keeping students up to date on what is happening around the school whilst giving some students the chance to broadcast opportunities to larger amounts like year groups or forms; reporting information about next weeks cake sale or school council meeting on a large scale. \nThis idea has several fortuity for expansion and generally improves students organization and management.	2019-09-10 17:03:53.588363

So when people rate your picture, the rating of you profile may increase as well.

2427	/startup-idea/active-school-shooter-escape-slide	When an airliner is in trouble, a slide is explosively inflated to allow passengers to disembark.  I propose making this an attachment to a window on the second floor of a school building.  Change it to a tunnel that inflates, line it with kevlar.  Active shooter enters building on first floor, teachers are alerted per ALICE training, and they take their students to a room at the end of the hall, where a teacher activates the tube.  The entire second floor of the building is evacuated in minutes.	2019-09-10 17:03:55.646255

Then the app will check other people who have the app in your contacts and sync their aPage  into your phone book. For security you could integrate it so that only people who have your number and you have their's can only see your page.

After that you just need to approve everything and the meeting is arranged.\nIf you have some free time (just 2 minutes, I don't think it takes more), could you please give some feedback or advices on this service. Here is a GoogleForm, which I'd like to use to analyze everything - http://goo.gl/forms/9zJEhmAUQP\nI appreciate any reasoned feedback.\nThanks!	2019-09-10 17:03:55.646255

Well this idea is, that you install an educational app, that popups with a simple question sometimes when you open your phone. <br>Like: 2+2 = ?<br>This will help educate people, by keeping them going. For an example I cannot remember what the Capital of Uganda is, even though we went through it in school. I was once able to recall all eu countries and their Capitals. If I had kept reversing it, I would remember it. <br>The idea here is to have different levels and courses to sign into. Each has a set of multiple choice questions the pupil has to answer. When the course is passed, sometimes when unlocking the phone, a question from the multiple choice pops up. The student must answer or it will continue to popup with a reminder every fifth minute. <br>In my example, I have to answer to a capital in Europe. In this way, I will reverse this maybe five times a day, and by this way keep reversing the curriculum. <br>Student classes, e-learning, study plans with multiple choices, alarm with obstacles, ads for founding, affiliate for study materials	2019-09-10 17:03:57.69384

I live in indonesia, where the level of poverty are high. Crimes to vehicle are everywhere Whether it is a crime to a parking car, or a moving car. Whether it is a small or huge crime. What if we create a company with a website/app that gathers people's experience, with a like button on it so we can see how many people are related to that, so we can get a sight of new vehicle crime modus out there, and we try to create a product/technology to prevent that from happening, and if the product sells well, we split the profit with them or give a royalty. First we can start by creating a simple product such as a finger print scanner behind the steering wheel to unlock the tire, or anything to get people to know us, and then we gather people's experience and build on it. Might take times and I know this is hard and we need brilliant ideas, crazy scientist, skilled engineer, and all, but if we target the product to countries with high vehicle crimes rate, we can make this happen, then maybe we'll expand into crimes modus other than vehicle.

2470	/startup-idea/crowd-based-spam-solution	Because my email address is out there in forums, registration boards and domain registries I get A LOT of spam. Traditional anti-spam filters are of little help. They use text analysis to try to detect whether the email is spam, phishing, etc and move them to your trash. This works in some cases, fails in others and sometimes gives false positives where legitimate emails end up in your junk folder.\nWhile unsolicitored emails are illegal, taking action requires individuals to make reports and for the relevant authority to take action without knowing the numbers of those affected. Few people have time to make complaints for every junk email item they receive. It would be a full time job in my case!\nThe solution I provide counters spam in two ways: \n1) By moving junk to the junk folder, sending automated reports to a central database \n2) Administrator take action against the spammers on behalf of all users who received the email\n\nThe service would work through web scripts for webmail and plugins for email clients (outlook,thunderbird, etc) for desktop and mobile which send reports to a central database.\n	2019-09-10 17:03:58.642663

2472	/startup-idea/global-cooperative-forum-gcf	Unlike traditional search engines that present you with a list of links that delegate you to another website or service to manage your request. GCF does the opposite and brings the website or service to you to be managed inside of virtual containers or forums.\n\nNow using basic messaging tools we can communicate with one or more services simultaneously as if we are all in the same room together, all in the same forum or conversation.\n\nWatch in the below video how easy it is to find help for a Diabetes and Eczema sufferer. Once a service has been discovered a request is created inviting that service to participate in a forum. By understanding and utilizing the world in this way people can self-organize and serve one another at an unlimited scale or resolution.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDaTsTkM1QE\n\n1) People, businesses and services can now serve one another at an unlimited scale or resolution. I.e. both vertically (all services) and horizontally (all requests).\n\n2) Problems or requests that could not scale prior to GCF such as deadly diseases, war, poverty and crime, can now scale to include the entire human community or all services and requests in the system simultaneously.	2019-09-10 17:03:58.642663

2480	/startup-idea/userfriendly-nose-bugger-remover	As humans beings we inhale and exhale on a daily basis. In the morning we shower and try cleaning up ourselves. Still throughout the day we inhale and exhale. There are always moments were we feel akward when we have wet or dry nose buggers in our noses. Some have to go to the toilet or a distant space or some do it on the spot with either a tissue or their fingers. How can we eleminate this issue and save up time. I have thought about an idea of designing an easy insertable yet still very comfortable nose net which holds all the dust and bad things in the air by the press of your nose can easily be removed. With this system your nose can remain clean, can easily be cleaned, and you avoid the akwardness of pulling boogers out of your nose. Also it protects you from germs and bacteria that may come from those who cough and sneeze. It is userfriendly, easy to insert and remove. Feels very comfortable in the nose. And last but not least unnotticable. I am looking for a developer who can listen to my idea and launch it on the market.	2019-09-10 17:03:59.907404

2483	/startup-idea/the-cereal-spoon	One of the things I love eating is a bowl of warm milk with sugar and preferable Kellogs Corn Flakes. But any Corn Flake cereal is good. I have noticed children enjoying it as well but many tend to waste or stop eating this due it getting to meshy. If you leave the flakes for longer then 15-20 seconds in the warm milk it will get meshy and most don't like it! So I have a way of eating corn flakes thst most children enjoy. It's actually not pouring milk over a bowl of corn flakes but pouring little by little cornflakes into the milk. So I have an idea about creating the Cereal Spoon. This spoon allows you to eat your cornflakes in a way while they are crunchy. The best way to eat corn flakes is when there is a minimal ammount of milk on your spoon and with the flakes being crunchy. My spoon idea will help you enjoy your cereal.	2019-09-10 17:03:59.907404

2503	/startup-idea/why-does-signage-plays-such-an-important-role	Informing, directing, and identifying; these are the three essential functions of signage. Signs enable people to get from point A to point B. Signs help identify places and tell us where to go. The value and importance of signage cannot be overstated. Let’s see how well-designed, well-placed signage help people in identifying and getting information about a particular location or thing.\n\nOutdoor signage: It is arguably the most important kind of signage because it’s the first impression visitors have of a business, facility or site. For example, outdoor engraved signs, monument signs, and directional signs are used as identification elements by visitors.\n\nInterior signage: Interior signage is the key to communicating with and guide visitors and staff throughout a facility. Reception signs, hanging signs or indoor directional signs help facility visitors in easy navigation.\n\nPromotional signage: Companies that understand the value of good signage invest in custom promotional signs such as neon and pylon signs to get the best return in investment. From retail point of view, promotional signage is the best attention grabbing solution for businesses.	2019-09-10 17:04:02.008771

2506	/startup-idea/e-recognizer	When people attend a professional conference, for example, they may just stand next to the person they have been communicating via e-mail for years but miss the opportunity to know each other. With an App e-Recognizer, your cell phone alerts you that one of your virtual friends is nearby. You may start a conversation with your professional colleagues, Facebook friends, or Twitter followers. Of course, an individual has to send invitations and accept invitations first. An individual can also screen the alerts and deactivate the alerts. For professional purposes (e.g., large conference attendees, university employees, business exhibition participants), employers may buy this App for their employees (group licenses). The App provides different levels/types of alerts, as long as an individual makes a choice and provides YES to some simple questions. This is also going to be a multi-language supported app. When everyone sticks to his/her cell phone in public these days, social isolation becomes an issue. This App can be revolutionary in encouraging social interaction.	2019-09-10 17:04:02.008771

I think someone needs to formulate a laundry product that keeps lint from clinging to innocent clothes. It will be extra useful if it worked well enough that towels wouldn't have to be washed apart from clothes.	2019-09-10 17:04:03.46053
2509	/startup-idea/cursor-theft-preventer-with-cursor-confusion	Lots of PCs are being controlled by their owner, but when the owners leave other people move the cursor and do other stuff, Then when you get back it's called Cursor Thief, So I present a new app called "Cursor Confusion"! This idea will end Digital Theft and Confuse others, Idea of it is that if you get tired of stolen cursors and unexpected apps and e.t.c, you can use cursor confusion, it places cursors all over the screen and the amount can be changed in the .ini file, but this idea must be in a .zip, otherwise people will infect the file with viruses, First, code in some cursors, Second, Code Lots of movement so the user never suspects, Third, Program clicking on best stuff to it, and the cursors grab the original cursors so that the cursor can interact with cursor changements, Fourth, Release a beta, so if anyone is broke they can get the beta instead of being limited by full version. And the rest, you got the idea.	2019-09-10 17:04:03.46053
2510	/startup-idea/ezhealth	Pain :\n There is a ton of information on internet about various diets, supplements, etc. Its a really huge industry but mostly driven by commercial interest. It is very difficult to find a diet that will best suite you because everyone's vital statistics, needs, etc are different. \nSolution:\n ezhealth is a platform for ordering food and supplements. It is different from grubhub, seamless, etc in many ways. Here is how it works:\nuser signs up\neither answers a few question about them or can upload data from their last blood test\nuser also tells goals that are health related. Ex lower my cholesterol, increase mass, increase vitamin, etc. \nEach user data is then shared with one of the certified nutritionist who setups up a meal plan for the whole week.\nUser start receiving their meals.	2019-09-10 17:04:03.46053

Without using a product with this cleansing ingredient, my hair looks greasy and weighed down. The problem with SLES is that it can be hard to wash out.

To move forward with this, there needs to be a strong and highly educated leaders and founders who can understand the concept and break it down to others.\n\nThere are millions of persons out there looking for answers but do not want to be attached to rituals or bound by ancient rules and this can offer that.  \n	2019-09-10 17:04:03.46053

The only people I knew in the area were my aunt and uncle (whom I was living with). I knew no one else my age (I'm 24 now). \n\nI came up with an idea of creating a website (and eventually a mobile app) where people (can be individuals, families, couples, etc.) can post up different event ideas in order to meet new people and build their networks and friendships in their new area.\n\nExample of an Event:\nI will be going to Happy Hour at Bar A on Friday at 5PM.\n\nThe event can be closed whenever (let's just say noon for now). After the clock hits 12PM, the event will be officially closed, and everyone who RSVP'd will then be put into a group chat with the event host being the group's moderator of sorts. The group chat is mainly there so everyone can discuss the minute details (i.e. types of drinks/foods available, the atmosphere, parking, etc). \n\nI would like to integrate and partner with Groupon into this site/app, as well, if possible. \n\nPlease let me know what you think!\n\n	2019-09-10 17:04:03.46053
2515	/startup-idea/screen-respite	An App. allows parents to have a positive control over their children’s iPad or Smartphone screen time. Parents may negotiate with their children regarding the total amount of time each week they are allowed to play with games or watch videos. Once a time limit is reached, certain functions of a device will be blocked. The App. also reminds users of the time used and time left for a certain period with pop-up messages. A small fee is charged for altering the setting prematurely (Yes, parents will be reluctant to give more play time to their children if they have to pay). Children eventually learn how to use their game time responsibly and evenly so they have a little fun every day. This App. prevents children from developing screen addiction. \n	2019-09-10 17:04:03.46053

The site will be specifically focused for Artists and Art lovers. Right now, we have websites like, Flipkart.com , snapdeal.com , amazon.in and many others but none of theme specifically focus on Art related stuff. This site will be soul platform for the Artists to present their art and For art lovers to directly connect with them. Many Art Enthusiasts who want to buy Art Stuff to decorate home with the ease of a click of a button, instead of going out in market wasting car fuel, time and money. So what do you think guys ? I have many plans but would not disclose all right now. This is the general basic Idea. I have lot of features and stuff to add in there. Please let me know your views on this Problem, many tech enthusiasts face and do you like my solution to it ?	2019-09-10 17:04:03.46053

2526	/startup-idea/global-auto-translated-chat-4-world-peace	Here is my idea to help create world peace!<br>Make an app that connects people from around the world through multiple language barriers and social stigma.<br><br>The core function of this app would be to randomly connect pairs of people to chat with each other. When you are connected, you have no idea who you are talking to or where they are from. You type in a message, and a list of pre-translated phrases comes up based on the typed text. You select which phrase to send to your chat partner. Pre-translated phrases are used since auto-translation doesn't always work. After the chat has ended, you fill out a survey that asks how you feel towards the person you just talked with, and you can add that person to a list of friends to chat again. Finally, information on your chat partner is revealed, like country, religion, native language etc.<br><br>Since language barriers create miscommunication and distrust, and social perception of different nationalities exists, it's difficult to communicate. This app will help everyone in the world to understand each other, and promote world peace.	2019-09-10 17:04:04.706483

2533	/startup-idea/book-publishing-development-marketing-solutions	Book publishers struggle with quantifying and qualifying markets before they make important decisions about how books are financed, marketed, and sold. This stems from underdeveloped communication processes with their readers.\n\nPublishers must make assumptions about how the book will perform without a foundation in real market data. Publishers then must hope for favorable data in the hands of their buyers (bookstores). \n\nMy solution is a consortium of online communities dedicated to establishing the foundations of successful nonfiction books. In each community, readers and potential authors generate and qualify content valuable to the creative processes already associated with developing a nonfiction book. Publishers access data specific to each of these communities, allowing them to quantify and qualify the market for unique nonfiction books of the future; then engage those communities to utilize their creative and communicative processes and bring successful nonfiction books to fruition.\n\nI’d like to collaborate with a developer with some experience in Drupal or a similar platform to build a prototype.\n	2019-09-10 17:04:04.706483

2538	/startup-idea/tell-me-a-story---readers-help-creative-authors	The publishing world is an incredibly intimidating place, and it discourages many would-be writers from following their passion.  Further, it's difficult for writers to share their early work even with close friends due to fear of rejection or ridicule.  It would really help creative writers if they had a non-threatening way to get an audience for their material, receive constructive feedback and pursue their best ideas.\n\nThe basic idea is for writers to post samples of their work on a website - a first chapter, for example - in an environment where their own identity is safe.  Readers would then simply read them and, if the material is interesting and they'd like to read more, they'll notify the author with a "like" button, or something similar.  If they don't like the story, they just exit it.  While there shouldn't be a "dislike" button, readers could give constructive feedback to the author based on their experience from the sample.\n\nAside from gaining the basic data of how many readers are interested in following the rest of the story, authors also see the average pages read, average time spent reading and other relevant data to indicate how interested most readers seem to be.	2019-09-10 17:04:06.740746

2543	/startup-idea/the-moving-market	I thought it would be awesome if there was a way to move to any place in the United States with the added benefit of financing options and job locating or relocating while assisting in the financial spectrum . This would be where you could pick a place, for example I want to uproot to Denver because my wife has a job offer but I don't have a job there and we live almost check to check so we don't have the ability. This would be a company that links up with many companies to ensure you have a job and an apartment or house when you arrive and lifepools (like carpool) you there. The company would arange something like this: You get an all service package of a moving team to help you get your belongings to Denver, a house is ready for your move in and your job starts in 1 week. The company pays for your first month(s) rent and you pay the company back similar to a car payment, perhaps over a 3 year period or 5 or whatever. <br>By:Nathan R. Cerruti	2019-09-10 17:04:06.740746

2546	/startup-idea/psbattle-for-smiles	PS (photoshop) battles are very popular on Reddit and other forums but they usually are just for pure entertainment.\n\nWhy not leverage people's willingness to use their PS skills for something better--like creating images that will put a REAL smile on an underprivileged or sick child's face. \n\nHow it would work: Reps from designated organizations (e.g. Children's Hospital) can post profiles (with both parent and kid approval) of kids with high res photos and descriptions of the kid's favorite things (e.g. I love IRON MAN!) and then volunteers will submit their best PS works of art to the child (e.g. showing kid riding on Iron Man).  The ones that make the kid smile, will earn special smile points or smile badges.  \n\nSo instead of earning fake internet points, they can earn real smiles.  \n\nCommunity board can have reddit like feed for kids profiles but default will show kids profiles with the LEAST love received so far so volunteers can make submissions to those.  \n\nThis would be non profit idea--I can't see how profitting off of sick children would ever make sense.\n\nThis nonprofit would measure success with just one metric--how many smiles did it deliver. =)\n\n	2019-09-10 17:04:06.740746

2556	/startup-idea/e-commerce-discounter	Hello everyone! I am trying to get a team of professionals together in order to develop an e-discounter with full infrastructure. The idea is to give any retailer an ability to sell through our site their products with a discount. It can range from last season sunglasses to last stock goods that retailer doesn't really want to take up the display space any longer. From each sale we collect 5-15% commission. I am located in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the market and culture for e-commerce is just starting to boom in our country! I poses the infrastructure of office space, warehouse, and finance. The economy in Kazakhstan is constantly showing stable growth rates after the crisis in 2009. In 2014 the annual growth has reached 6%. As a result retail trade sector is also growing; the volume reached over 28 bln.USD. E-commerce is still the most dynamic market segment, its volume is over 1.5 bln.USD, according to J’son & Partners Consulting  experts’.	2019-09-10 17:04:07.921574

It would be nice to see local participating restaurants for an application so you can set a time to eat, order food already, and even pay the bill from your phone.  The idea is to sit down and have the food ready for you within the first five minutes.  The application will set up times and relay the information to the establishment. In return the busy establishments will be able to get food out faster as well as serve costumers faster.

2563	/startup-idea/cloud-vault	"Cloud vault"...a concept very similar to cloud computing where your data is secured and easily accessible from virtually anywhere and to anyone you want. Imagine the application of this idea to actual physical information. Documents, valuables and other items that you keep in a safe protected. With peace of mind that you can access them anytime you want and that they're secured. But the real issue here is mobility. You can't access your safe from anywhere you want. In case of mobility you risk the information by carrying them. Now imagine a highly motivated team which is commited to keep your physicle information safe just like in a vault, but, at the same time your vault is capable to move with you anywhere you want. with a click or drag from your computer you can actually initiate the movement of your physical data in realtime to anywhere you want, ensuring not only mobility but high security at the same time. Sharing in realtime is also possible given the access rights to whomever you desire.<br><br>This idea can be applied if banks and delivery services can collaborate with each other providing each other with the assets and expertise in this value-added service.<br>	2019-09-10 17:04:07.921574

2568	/startup-idea/hybrid-car	Fuel and pollution is major concern of us today.We have now electric car driven by charged battery.However battery can't easily provide high starting torque or power stroke when car is on upward slope/bumpy road/rough terrain.On contrast 4 stroke engine are only efficient when operated at designed speed uninterruptedly.At slow speed/consecutive brakes it is less efficient and pollute more. The net heat efficiency of a 4 stroke engine is much much less than a DG. If we design a future car that combine DG,Battery Back up and DC Series Motor such a way we charge battery when car is idle,run the DC motor through battery and the motor rotates the axle of the car. When battery depleted, DG will start and feed it.The generator also start when power stroke is required. In addition we place solar roof top panel on car to charge battery, run ac/sound system when on run.We can run DG in most efficient way rather than a 4 strike engine. DC series motor run the car like traction. Weight of car & incorporating all things in small car is a major concern. But this challenge is acceptable considering our future. Govt must come forward to encourage the idea. First we should work with some prototype.	2019-09-10 17:04:08.735622

There is a preview link provided to share across social networks or via email. But again, not searchable on the site, only through the efforts of the author.\n\nIn addition to the 50 (non-commercial) stories, there will be 10 auctioned tiles each day that commercial or non-commercial interests can bid on to secure a place on the wall.

The ap could be programmed to text them to see if they then respond. If not, then the ap could automatically contact via text or voice a family member, friend or 911 if nobody else could contact the  elderly or disabled family member.<br>This kind of ap will save many lives so it would be great if a very low cost or free version was available.	2019-09-10 17:04:09.552996

There is no main ubiquitous platform outside of YouTube and Twitch that unifies all gamers together and allows them to share and collate their experiences and connect with each other.\n\nMy solution is simple: create the anonymous group for gaming. Anyone can use the clan tag (whatever that may be) and if they share their content to the site with the website shown somewhere at the beginning of the video/image then they receive coupons for gaming merchandise or money. Undercutting rates provided by YouTube and Twitch will be essential to do this but we can utilise the infamous image of the anonymous hacker group and make something that all gamers can be a part of.	2019-09-10 17:04:09.552996

Upon completion of the college and getting a job, the person has the option of buying back their shares from the public completely or partially after a few years. This can also work for musicians, artists, or athletes.	2019-09-10 17:04:10.665194

2600	/startup-idea/whatsapp-for-every-purpose	I want to create something like Whatsapp but with a twist. You will be able to create groups (not group chatting) for contacts, eg. friends, work, family etc, so that you will be able to have different profiles for contacts in the separate groups, eg. your status could say "the party was crazy!!" for contacts in your *friends* group with profile picture of you in a pool. Then your other status could say "Thank God its friday" for your *work* group with a profile picture of you in a suit. Same analogy for family. You will be able to add one contact in all groups. There will be a *general* profile so that people who you havent selected any group for can see.	2019-09-10 17:04:10.665194

2602	/startup-idea/a-modular-backpack-that-fits-all-your-needs	Hi guys,\nI’m a student at Technical University of Munich, Germany. In the context of a seminar I`m currently developing the concept of a super cool new backpack system and would love to hear your opinion about it.\nThe basis of the system consists of a back panel with shoulder straps. The items you need are organized in specialized attachable bag compartments. These compartments are attachable to the back panel (and one another) via an easy and quick to use click-in system. That way,\n1)\tyou have one backpack system that fits all your needs, no need for additional bags anymore\n2)\tyou always have access to all your articles\n3)\tyour backpack is always perfectly organized, your items are separated if you need them to be\n4)\tyour backpack is as specialized as you need it to be (e.g. camera gear + clothing + food)\nThe system also comes with a home storage solution (e.g. wall hanging) which helps you to\n1)\tstay organized by having all your specialized bag compartments in one place\n2)\tnever forget anything because everything you might need is in direct sight\nSo what do you think about this concept? Can you think of scenarios where you would find such a system useful?	2019-09-10 17:04:10.665194
2603	/startup-idea/autoshared	Imagine a situation when you are travelling to a far away place without any good camera/mobile device but still want to capture the beautiful moments with your near and dear ones. How would you do it? You would probably request the strangers around you for the little help in getting your pictures captured by their own camera/mobile device. Once they have taken your pictures, you would ask them to send those pictures to your email id (conventionally).\n\nI think, we can optimize the way in which people share the captured pictures. We can make the whole process asynchronous, automatic and more productive.\n\nWe can develop an app which can send the pictures to the right owners by correctly identifying them from the Internet (through image database or another image recognition service).	2019-09-10 17:04:10.665194

Well, what if we have a central place online that allows us to post questions and get answers on...pretty much everything.  The questioner chooses a topic and posts the question, other people see the question or search for topics they're interested and post the solutions.

Example I want to buy a Basketball shoes, I will check the app pick the nearest mall and Check Nike What shoes are available right now. It will save time if I can see what's available on the store. If a product I am looking is out of stock on that mall, I can Check the other mall... Probably, there would also be a chat inquiry on each establishments on each malls.. In short  you can see the whole pic of the store and see what available for this week, then you can chat that store in the mall if they have this size or if it is still available... You can also check prices and compare it to the other mall stores..	2019-09-10 17:04:10.665194

This "game application" will be freemium, for example the loser can buy new "life" to continue the tournament or you have a limited participation for a tournament in the day. We can search some companies to be our partners and make advertising our way to make money. We can also create a social network between people who will play to our game. I search for developers in Android and IOS.	2019-09-10 17:04:11.751704
2609	/startup-idea/entre-spirit	I see the timing and cost of developing an app being a very pricey proposition for the consumer. So similar to how easy it is to open a checking and savings account, I think an application should be just as easy.

2612	/startup-idea/storetracer	My idea greatly works for people who are greedy for clothes and who are particular about stuff like type of dress,color ,size ,material used.Most people must be fed up roaming and wasting  time in shopping particularly women and in big cities it takes a lot of time in travelling . Though we have lots of online shopping sites the problem is we dont know whether dress suits us or not unless we make a trial and also we are not sure about the material used unless we personally check it.So my idea is to create an app or website that takes all the details like type of dress you want,color ,price range and it will give you the list of shops along with their address who are having similar kind of dress and we can directly go and grab the dress we like and can save a lot of time.please suggest me if there is an app already existing.	2019-09-10 17:04:11.751704
2613	/startup-idea/choose-your-music-in-public	At a social meeting, pub, restaurant or cafe. Fire up your phone and enter a title of a track and have it loaded to the queue of the TV in real-time. Youtube video (using youtube api) matching the search query is submitted into a playlist and displayed on the screen. Multiple people in the room/area can submit multiple tracks and if the track already exists in the queue, the track will be 'upvoted' and boosted up in the queue. The more popularity, the higher up in the queue.<br>So essentially, the app will play the music video that people in the area want the most.	2019-09-10 17:04:11.751704

There would be a story mode for lonely players and a arcade mode for online role playing or team players. \nPlayers would be guided through real maps of their surrundings using Google map and POI. The App server would have to modelize the story independently of the players locations, using POI as references. Player would be rewarded on objectives completions.	2019-09-10 17:04:11.751704

2616	/startup-idea/call-safety-and-support	Do you have to memorize all the numbers of public service agencies like ambulance, firefighters, police station, electricity and water utilities, trash collectors, and many others? Can you take the pain of adding more those numbers in your personal contacts to feel safer? Suppose you move into another foreign country, who will give you the list of such important numbers when you need them most? \nSolution: these numbers should be as near as possible because we often need them in emergency scenarios. Making a huge list of those numbers and hanging them on street wouldn't do. I am kindly suggesting if we could use available technology to make them accessible on our mobile devices as far as one click. Imagine tourists or newly immigrants in whichever country who don't feel safe, or people in desperate situations who can't reach help. We need these kind of contacts just one click away without having to ask which number is for this and that.\nI hope you may give other suggestions to make this service better and let me know if you really think this solution would be of help in your community.\n	2019-09-10 17:04:11.751704

I want to be able to drop similar task into a block of time, so I can divide the day into blocks of similar task. For instance I would like work on long written tasks from 9-12, and make calls from 1-3 and short written task from 3-5 pm. As I enter a task I want to categorize it and depending on its category it would be inserted into a time block.  If the task  was not completed I could manually move it to a specific block of time, or it would automatically move to the next bloc of set aside for that task. Within the task block I should be able to move task up and down into the order I want to tackle that particular task list.  Task need to be able to be dragged and dropped from day to day and moved into a specific order of completion within the block of time.	2019-09-10 17:04:11.751704
2619	/startup-idea/dog-of-the-block	Overcrowded animal shelters can choose to house dogs through this non-profit. A dog-loving member of the community can volunteer to donate a small portion of their lot for construction of a fenced-in area with a dog house. Ideally, the kennel would be right next to the sidewalk, and passer-bys can reach over and pet the dog, feed the dog, and maybe a leash can be hanging up and they can even take the dog for a walk. The pooch would truly be cared for by the community. The dog's quality of life is improved, the community comes together to raise it, and the dog/shelter gets more exposure to the public, increasing the dog's chances of being adopted by a family.	2019-09-10 17:04:11.751704
2620	/startup-idea/travelnetworking	I had this idea where you could use mapping to give travellers in a city a guide to where the safe and possibly dangerous parts of a city are - where locals and tourists can share their tips on where to go and where to stay, and offer real-time info on where they maybe experienced pickpockets, ATM card scamming, or other scams to keep tourists informed of what to watch out for.\nie - Im going to Bogota and want to see where people have experienced trouble, or possibly see where might be an area to book a hotel that isn't in a seedy or dangerous neighbourhood.

2621	/startup-idea/tasty-n-healthy---mess-facility-at-your-doorstep	It has been found that most people today, especially unmarried ones are busy with their work be it any job or business and also students living alone. They hardly get time to cook themselves food and at the same time, take care of their health. People are a victim of junk food these days, neither can everyone afford to eat at good restaurants every day.\n\nSo, how about starting something where housewives or chefs or retired professionals with interest in cooking contribute to the benefit of the people and at the same time earn money? I have a startup plan where there will be a network of cooks(housewives/chefs/retired persons or anyone interested in cooking) which will be delivered to the customers who subscribe the facility. I'll control the entire delivery system. The cooks will get their money as soon as they get their individual customer. The "Mess facility" service will be much affordable keeping in mind the profit of the cooks working under me. The best way to increase the business is to make it app based and using a Share and Earn option. The more people join with one's promo code, the more discount does he get.	2019-09-10 17:04:12.786938

For example, if you learn programming it gives you a quest for learn algorithm, and after completion you will get prize for this quest. Users can define their own goals and make their own quest lines and share with others. But application will have it's own set of the most popular goals. \n\nMaybe users can encourage each other throw the comments about achieves that they earned while using app.\n\nIdea is little bit similar to other self productivity tools.

2627	/startup-idea/social-search-network-for-shopping-malls	When visiting a store/hopping mall a lot of things can be annoying: Finding a store that has a specific item in stock, finding that specific store (especially if it's a large mall or new to you), finding a place with your favorite food, finding out if a specific restaurant is crowded, comparing prices of items among stores... .\n\nWhen you are at the store/hopping mall or before you go there you could use the app to ask people who are there or store staff, for example: \n\nYou could upload a picture of a black shirt you saw somewhere and ask people if they have seen it somewhere in the mall.\nYou could ask where you can eat good burgers.\nYou could ask if there are any seats left in a specific restaurant.\n\nWhoever answers gets "mall points", at a certain level you can exchange it for money, vouchers etc. Companies have real-time access to customers (and potential customers) and can answer (supported by chatbots for simple question) if they have the item you need or seats left in their restaurant. \n\nThis good further be enhanced be providing indoor-navigation with, for example, beacons to help people find the location of their products.\n	2019-09-10 17:04:12.786938

2642	/startup-idea/walking-buddies	It works like uber (not a great start for a pitch, but bear with me :) ), but instead of calling a car, the user calls someone (walking buddy/w.b.) who lives near by to come to a location of your choice and walk/drive you home. To ensure a higher level of security and privacy, two w.b. closest to the user will be picked randomly by the system to walk the user home. \n\nIt's for people who has to walk home alone but feel afraid/anxious that they may be vulnerable to abuse of any kind and on the other hand also for people who wish to a more active role in making their community a safer place.\n\nPeople can download the app and volunteer to help walk people home or request someone to walk them home.\n\nOnce they make it home safe, they can choose to donate 1 dollar to the app, the money will be used for maintaining the service and any unused money will be donated to charity groups for supporting minorities/LGBT/women rights.	2019-09-10 17:04:13.935242

It’s not so easy to find someone to have a coffee with without being in a big group. <br>I suggest a meet new friends app for everyone who wants to meet new people and have a chat. The target age-group are big and should be 30-60 years rather than 15.<br>Not to find a new relationship or to have sex. Just friendship.<br>The app could be just like a dating app, but only with nice pictures…and the pictures are not that important if you are only looking for a friend.<br>If you are married and maybe new in town, looking for new friends, you don’t want to join a dating app. You want to find someone with similar interests, maybe for a glass of wine, cup of coffee, shopping, walking or movies.<br>I have only found one similar app, Hey! Vina, but I think it’s too simple for me. The Meetup app feels too organized for me.<br>Maybe separate apps for women and men?<br>What do you think? Maybe its already out there?

2646	/startup-idea/linkedin-for-bootcamp-student	For a long time I have heard the myth that there are no entry level in software development especially for bootcamp students. This is far from the truth. The problem is that employers don't have the ability to judge students on more than a quick intro at the bootcamp's final project fair. Disciple Jobs aims to be the hub and connecting network for bootcamp students and entry level employers. Students can post journal entries about what they're learning everyday and post github projects. Posting journal entries and committing to github class projects will give students points adding a gamification aspect. Employers will also be able to create code challenges like HackerRank (or choose from pre-made ones) and circulate them throughout the student community creating a sort of bait-and-fish tactic for finding qualified candidates.	2019-09-10 17:04:13.935242

The idea was firstly inspired by the fact that in the tourism and hospitality field, the Small and Medium Enterprises often do not have enough research support due to their limited funding and human resource.\n2.\tLack of empirical and financial support in academic sectors. The academia of this field on the other hand often seeks for empirical data from the industry for better understanding of the status, problem and solutions.\n3.\tThe communication methods between the industry and the academia are merely dispersed and traditional, usually involving face-to-face meetings created by conferences, special events, and personal networking.\n\nSolution:\nFor the first time, we will have a virtual community that specifically serves the field of tourism and hospitality for the purpose of project collaboration globally. Meanwhile, it is a virtual platform for researchers and industry practitioners to socialize and exchange knowledge via online activities.	2019-09-10 17:04:14.994416

Everything will be location-based like Pokemon Go and features interactions and events like: the hunt for PoE (Pieces of Eden), versus between 2 players from different size, war, etc... I know  to implement a game with all features like Pokemon Go will cost an arm and a leg (half a million dollars). Therefore, I intend to minimize my game as much as it could.

2684	/startup-idea/trade-conceptconsumers-and-manufacturers	A concept for an online trade platform. To bring manufacturers and consumers together in a new and exciting way. Example...A manufacturer would list wholesale 100 watches for $5000.,Value of each watch being $50. Retail value being $500. The consumer would make a deposit for the watch and enter into a group sale,as another consumer makes a deposit the number of sales on the 100 watches goes up. Once the sale for the 100 watches is met then the remainder of the deposit is collected and the sale goes through to the manufacturer as a single sale. It would be the risk of the manufacturer to honour the sale after 10 days no matter how many watches are sold. Cost of watch would include postage to Australia. Additional delivery cost within Australia would be calculated based on weight and postcode. The delivery service within Australia would be outsourced. PayPal would be the best solution for finance transactions. The group sale of 100 would add an element of excitement to the consumer as they would be able to monitor the number of sales taken,also they would be able to share the sale with liked minded friends etc. I would love to hear of any feedback you have for this concept.	2019-09-10 17:04:17.509019

The app will look automaticaly in your school schedule an plan the journey.\n\nI have already started designing and building the app. I'm trying to build the app in React-Native, because im new to this framework I am encountering some problems.\n\nIf you have any questions or want to help me with this project you can mail at mansurdehpoor@gmail.com\n	2019-09-10 17:04:17.509019
2691	/startup-idea/social-welfare-platform-for-crowd-sourcing	In the developing countries like India, NGOs (Non-governmental organization) and different social welfare organizations/groups work more for social welfare than the governments.  These organizations use Facebook pages, WhatsApp groups or their websites for listing activities, crowd-sourcing and donations. But they do not always get proper response and find proper people who can help them.\n\nMy idea is to develop a platform (website & app), where these organizations can create their accounts, connect to the local people to involve them in their events and crowd-source them for different social welfare activities. People can also use this platform to seek help from these organizations, involve in the crowd-sourcing activities and donate them as per their wish. \n\nIn one word, this platform will help the organizations to connect to the crowd directly, engage them in their activites, increase donations; and help people to involve in different welfare activities, as well as to seek help from the right organizations when they need.\n\nIf you like this idea and think that it can work, then drop en email to shubhadeep.banerjee2011@yahoo.com. We can discuss the idea to take in further.	2019-09-10 17:04:18.435506
2692	/startup-idea/cloud-simulation-for-engineering-applications	Simulation of many components demands a large amount of computations.Most of the simulations take much longer time which makes it very difficult to use the available methods effectively.It's because of the non availability of high end processors and huge amount of ram with every person.So, there will be a delay in the completion of project.My idea is to create a cloud platform which is supported by a large amount of ram and high end processors so that engineers can make use of it by paying an amount.There are services already available for the same, but they are not so effective to meet the demands.I am looking for a team to collaborate with.For more details,interested people can contact me.	2019-09-10 17:04:18.435506

It also pains me to see the stress it puts on delivery boys to drive through unpredictable busy traffic to deliver the items on time. If we could devise a kind of light weight plastic flat hot box that would have a properly moulded space to hold the pizza snugly, it would be of great use. The pizza can be transferred directly to the hot box, hot box is closed and taken out for delivery. Since item remains hot for much longer time there need not be much haste in delivery. The pizza may be transferred to the plate or to a similar customer's hot plate and the vendors hot plate is returned for re use.	2019-09-10 17:04:19.274396

2712	/startup-idea/automated-software-testing-on-azure-cloud	The idea is about running in parallel test cases that have already been automated, via free test automation software like Sikuli for example.<br><br> The software tester in the company can automate some tests (using Sikuli or some otherfree image capturing software)  and instead of running these tests on his own which can take a lot of time, you use Azure where you can start as many virtual machines as you want (they are very cheap), automatically install the OS you want, company software and run that test case. You can then run 100’s if not 1000’s of testcases in parallel as it is very cheap to create virtual machines in Azure. You can charge for the time taken for each test case for example.<br><br>You can be the company that offers this service. A company gives you the automated test cases they have created along with their software, you install it on their preferred OS in Azure, and happily run these test cases, reporting back the test results directly as they come.	2019-09-10 17:04:19.274396

2715	/startup-idea/enterprise-farming-model	Farmers are vulnerable in many ways. Most significant are: 1. Input quality related particularly seed 2. Yield and productivity 3. Water management 4. Best Agronomic practices 4. NATURAL CALAMITIES - Local climatic phenomena (Like Hal Storms) 5. Drought 5. Monsoon failures post sowing/(mid crop/end crop etc. ) 6.Price and Market 7. Farm income (Farming shall be attractive business). Few of the issues can be solved and have robust solutions. But what a farmer needs is comprehensive solution. However, all issues and problems can not be solved whatever the model of farming be. But, all the problems of farmers can be controlled, balanced, checked, minimized and managed so that suicides and farming distress can be reduced to considerable level and most importantly income of farmer can be raised substantially and farming can be made thoroughly professional and highly attractive vocation to one and all. This is where Enterprise Farming Model Stands as big start-up opportunity. A clear point to be noted is this model is principally based on aggregation principle but no way this is contract/cooperative/collective farming - not even tenant/leased farming.	2019-09-10 17:04:19.274396

2765	/startup-idea/a-detachable-car-can-detach-to-a-2-seater	TRAFFIC CONGESTION:... Every day I see thousands of office commuters, using their CARS to office, most of them driving alone. For Office commute a person needs a 2 seater car. But these are not a great "Hit" in the market, since a person also needs the same car for his family during weekends. So no one wants to buy 2 cars, one for office & second for family.\nSOLUTION:- Make a family car, which can detach out into a 2 seater version for office commute, reattach for family commute.\nThe 2 seater could have its smaller engine at the front, & the family seater could have a larger engine at the rear. New car designs moving on to electric powered (Eco friendly versions) will find it easier to incorporate this improvisation during their initial design stage itself.. I strongly feel such a car will play a big role in addressing many problems ..Traffic congestion, parking problems, Fuel savings, ease of commute etc..etc..  \n	2019-09-10 17:04:25.588413

2795	/startup-idea/uber-for-charter-plane	Normally a small size charter plane has approximately eight seats or more. Often the people who hire a whole charter plane have some seats vacant. In a research it's been found that the people who hire charter planes are not less concerned for money. They value for money. But they value for privacy very much.\n\nThe idea is to create an app that connects a person who has hired the whole charter plane (the host) to rent out any unused seat. The guest who will take the rent can fly by private charter at lower cost by this service.\n\nAs privacy of the host is very important we will have to ensure proper communication between two parties via the App. The guest has to convince the host like we do before Airbnb booking. Other security measures also need to be taken like take picture of NID, passport via the app.\n\nBenefit to the host:\n->Extra income\n->Even a person can use the app for business (by hiring and rent out) when it gets popular\n\nBenefit to the guest:\nFly private by charter plane at lower price\n	2019-09-10 17:04:27.440996

2838	/startup-idea/smart-shoe	CNT infused textile pressure sensor.  These piezoresistive sensors are sensitive to wide pressure ranges. One potential application for the CNT infused fabric is to measure forces on people's feet as they walk, run, stand etc. in real time. The CNT layer is just 250 to 750 nanometers thick - about 0.25 to 0.75 percent as thick as a piece of paper - and would only add about a gram of weight to a typical shoe or garment. What's more, the materials used to make the sensor coating are inexpensive and relatively eco-friendly, since they can be processed at room temperature with water as a solvent. Looking for collaborators (electrical engineering,  mobile app development, electrical impedance/resistivity tomography etc.) and investors interested in working with us to develop these next generation apparels and shoes.	2019-09-10 17:04:30.312395

This way different people may create adapters for different ToDo apps. Therefore the time-tracking becomes universal.\n\nAs for the time-tracking itself. I imagine a tray icon (Windows/Mac OS/Linux). When clicked - it shows a list of tasks.  Second click selects the task and the timer starts ticking. Switching tasks is just two clicks. It should detect when I'm not using the computer for 3 minutes and auto stop. Android/iOS apps can be made as well, but most people WORK on a computer and PLAY on the phone.\n\nI'm a developer and can do it it Electron and Flutter.

2843	/startup-idea/music-crowdfunding	It's easy to assume that everyone loves music, but do we all love what's being played commercially? I have started an online label that is called First Few Steps with the slogan that says "A label for the unknown". The truth is that I have always wanted to share the talents of others with the world, but the bitter truth is that there's a lot of competition to get to the listener's ear. The best advantage of music is that royalties will always exist and this is where I would share the profits with those that are involved. Secondly, your funding could help more than one song, which means that even if you contribute a once off amount, that amount could be divided into 2 or more songs, giving you a portfolio of music to earn royalties from more than one song. The talent is everywhere to be found but it desperately needs promotion and I hope that fellow music lovers will at least consider this idea.	2019-09-10 17:04:30.312395

While we continue making the system more feature packet each week we charge them more until we reach $300/$500.<br><br>Example:<br>We create a demo that they like, they pay $100/month for using this demo. Each week we release a new version with new features, the monthly subscription increases by $25/month until we reach around $300-$500 a month.<br><br>Is this a suitable business model.<br><br>I am a new entrepreneur and would love some feedback.<br><br>Thanks for reading :)	2019-09-10 17:04:31.178502

2860	/startup-idea/software-development-factory	Insane, but can you imagine if it existed? It takes time and money to develop apps. What if a machine can do if for you, for free!! There are millions of developers around the world who can pitch-in their knowledge for this community web-app. I will not get into all the details but here is the general idea:Using AI, it would be nice to develop a web app which writes code, debugs, QA's itself and learns from its mistakes. Developers can watch what the machine is doing live (and be amazed by  what it is doing automatically ) and if  "machine" gets stuck at some point, "developer" would come to the rescue, enter "edit mode" and provide the solution in the code, "machine" will learn from it, and hopefully never make it again. Putting it to good use: Say Scott wants a medical/restaurant app, you name it. He goes to the Software Factory site, answers a bunch of questions to help the machine start coding, and then just becomes a spectator of how the desire software gets built, like watching a movie. <br><br>It is a crazy idea I know, but hey, thousands of years ago who would've thought we were going to fly, go to space, or have a cell phones with all the features they now have!!	2019-09-10 17:04:32.567558

2867	/startup-idea/pet-friendly-resort	Pets, for a lot of people are a part of their family. There is a huge segment of families/individuals who wish to take their pet along for holidays but are unable to do so as most Hotel/ Resorts are not pet friendly. Even if there are certain brands that claim to be pet friendly, there are no adequate facilities to enjoy vacation/  weekend breaks with their pet babies.\n\nWe suggest 40 to 50 pet friendly cottages in a natural, spacious environment, with provision of entertainment & activities for human and animal members of families. A location that is within 200 KMs of at least two important and large cities, would be ideal as the resort can be used for other purpose like MICE & corporate off sites.	2019-09-10 17:04:32.567558
2868	/startup-idea/start-an-online-travel-activities-marketplace	People nowadays are more interested in traveling to places where they can indulge in various activities like mountain biking, trekking, whale watching, etc. As a result, adventure travel has gained massive popularity in recent years.\n\nIt is expected that the compound annual growth rate will grow 45.99% by 2020 for adventure tourism. Regular site seeing or beachside vacations are expected to take a backseat. Adventurous activities, like the ones we mentioned earlier, are high in demand nowadays.\n\nA rise in adventure tourism has led to an increase in tourism in countries where adventure travel destinations are high in numbers such as France, Germany, Spain, and Iceland.\n\nTherefore, online travel activity marketplace is a viable business option that promises a good fortune. Many of you might be thinking of the easiest way to build a travel activity marketplace. As an expert, I have a solution. FunAway, it is the advanced technology solution available in the market, to build an online travel activity marketplace. User-friendly experience provided by this system further provides easier communication between host and travelers.	2019-09-10 17:04:32.567558
2869	/startup-idea/orgo---the-farming-revolution	This idea is related to organic farming. Traditional farming way in our country is not enough provide us quality food because knowledge and source are not being provided to farmer in our country. Nowadays consumer need quality food but our system is not able to maintain quality and safety standard as per requirement. High dose of pesticides and urea is damaging us as slowly that we are not aware of. India need and ecosystem to maintain crop standard. May be this idea is not worth of making huge bunch of money but we can make a safe future for becoming generation. What we ate, is what we are, either its body or mind.\nIn first hand we are planning to offer land to our consumer which we would hire from farmers. If any consumer only wants product then we can deliver at its door. We would work as a farms aggregator and organic food marketplace. Here are several point to be discus which can not be done here as this sector has a very high potentiality of work.	2019-09-10 17:04:32.567558
2870	/startup-idea/currency-barter	I have been into foreign exchange business and I know the challenges especially as a foreign national in North America trying to send money to Africa or from Africa. This also applies to Asia and the likes.  \nProblem: Many people in developing countries have poor financial transaction infrastructure internationally. Foreign exchange is a big issue. Bank charges are much and this was disrupted by companies like PayPal etc.\nHowever, there are a number of countries in continents like Africa that are still disenfranchized from PayPal and many payment platforms. This makes foreign exchange a big challenge. There is always a big loss in terms of fees.\nSolution: Create a website that people can post their currency needs and match with someone who has. The idea is just like Swapsy but there will be some other twists to it like escrow services, doing business with our partners, supporting local businesses etc.  \nAdvantages: Our fees are infinitesimal. The users set their exchange rates themselves. Money does not leave any of the countries. There are few players in this space but it needs to be disrupted strategically and voraciously. Can you join me?\n	2019-09-10 17:04:32.567558

2881	/startup-idea/intoxicated-or-not	Hi Guys, I had this idea about an app that tells you whether you are intoxicated or not and would appreciate all inputs. I don't mean the existing apps out there which require inputs such as age, wt, drinks... This idea is based on a person's reflexes. For eg - A target moves across the screen on your phone in a random manner and you are supposed to hit the target in a given amount of time.The first step would be having a reference performance point. Store your performance on this test without any alcohol in your system i.e hit rate, misses etc and it would serve as a reference point. After a couple of drinks retake the test and based on your reference performance on the test, the app would tell you whether you are intoxicated or not. Worse the results, the more intoxicated you are. The results would determine your level of intoxication.The new (not mature yet) eye tracking technology could also be used. The app would have a  target move across the screen and based on the initial calibration of your eye ( without any alcohol in your system)and the your tracking performance ( with alcohol in your system) , the app can judge the alcohol level.	2019-09-10 17:04:34.069385

2889	/startup-idea/urban-role-play-project-chaos	Urban Role Play: Project Chaos\n\nMost people long for entertainment, even more so in the real world, as most of them spend nearly all their day in front of a computer. Furthermore people want to belong, get to know people and not be isolated. Project Chaos (name stolen from Fight club) can deliver right that: Its an offline role play between groups, trying to win parts of the city. Every registered user (of all parties) gets to know a task at a specific time, say every Sunday at noon. It could vary from having people form the biggest smiley on a square, to first find the house with the number Pi sprayed on it, to whatever on can image and is legal. Who wins gets a part of the city shown on the site. A maximum of organization should be left to the groups, whether they act as a loose network or as structured units. Tasks should be shaped to encourage the group formation, so that the social factor pay off. Membership would cost a small monthly fee which would encourage people to join as many events as they can. \n\n	2019-09-10 17:04:35.023054
2890	/startup-idea/a-worldwide-special-business-school	Have you ever gone oversea and noticed business concepts that motivated and inspired you? And maybe in the back of your mind, you were thinking, hey, I can do this back in my country?\n\nI am not talking about franchise, although it can be part of it. But I am talking about small and mid size businesses. For example, in Hong Kong, they have these fast food stalls that sell noodles in small packets. Basically all the ingredients and other side dishes are in small individual packets on their own. You just take the packets that you wanted, the noodle, the sauce, or additional side dishes. Then when you want to eat them, you just pour them all into the noodle packet. Quite innovation in its own unique way. And I have friends in Australia and India expressing their interests in maybe having this in their own countries. But I was unable to help them as I am not from Hong Kong and I do have Hongkies friends that know that trade.\n\nSo that's where this business idea comes in. The special school will source for the knowledge and teach them.	2019-09-10 17:04:35.023054

2916	/startup-idea/fingerprint-security-scanner	The iphone 5s has a fingerprint scanner which is already an excellent security feature. But there is one more thing you could add to it to make it better. The fingerprint scanner will be an app that runs in the background and records the fingerprints every time you unlock your screen and  sends you a daily email with the fingerprints that have been used to unlock the screen. So incase you say your phone gets stolen, there is a high chance that the person who steals your phone presses the home button and as he does that fingerprint scanner app does its job and records the fingerprint which you would receive at the end of the day. And this way you would be able to figure out the fingerprint of the person who stole your phone. There could also be many more uses to this idea.As this is a security feature many companies that use iphones for their businesses would consider this app as they would also be able to track down who has access to the company phone through the fingerprints.<br><br>	2019-09-10 17:04:37.460258

2920	/startup-idea/the-cooler-redesigned	Problem: The cooler box design has remained virtually unchanged since its inception.  Coolers are heavy and bulky BEFORE you even add ice!  Once cooler boxes are full with ice, food, and beverages they become extremely heavy and awkward.

2924	/startup-idea/doordash-and-yelp-for-japanese-food-in-us	I want to solve a health problem and hunger for Japanese food.\n\nJapanese food is called 'WASYOKU' in Japan. So my business concept is 'WASYOKU on demand'.\n\nI know Japanese food is very healthy. When I visited US last month for 1 week, I gained 3 kilos with American Food. After coming back to Japan, with Japanese food I lost 3 kilos. Now I believe American should eat more Japanese food.\n\nAnd  I thought it was very difficult to find Japanese food restaurants in NY. Yelp was poor at Japanese food.\n\nSo I'm making smartphone application that enables  you to find Japanese restaurants or order Japanese food's delivery(catering) service much more easy.	2019-09-10 17:04:37.460258

I would set up a computer screen in restaurants with kickstarter projects that appeal to local foodies, in boutiques with projects that appeal to moms, in skate shops with projects that appeal to skaters, in surf shops with projects that appeal to surfers, in video game stores, malls, etc. I would charge the project makers to be advertised in those stores, but if they don't make their goal, I give some money back as a pledge to their project and sell one of the items myself in the store. It could also be a way for businesses to publicize upcoming events or products that they want to produce.	2019-09-10 17:04:37.460258

2935	/startup-idea/extremely-long-lasting-energy	I want to resolve the use of polluting power plants and dangerous play with radioactive elements just to power cities. I suggest the use of the scientific fact of electromagnetism and the fact that electricity generates a magnetic field and a magnetic field generates electricity. How about we use an atom that is extremely positive and an atom that is extremely negative and shoot them very close to one another in a circular motion in opposite directions of each other, the idea should be that this cause sudden electric charges to generate because of friction between the two atoms and use a superconducted thin layer of gold to capture these raw energy and harvest it this way. Now this idea is still not perfect so I'm just wondering if this idea could be the start of a possible invention that can help with the electric power solution and even possibly send us humans into outerspace.	2019-09-10 17:04:38.550337

What I suggest is to literally get people off of their butts into action toward an idea that they have. We will separate ideas into categories and you can have teams run for your idea (particularly if you have an idea but cannot run) The only requirement to run the race itself is to raise money for your idea but there will be a charge if you want to attend the after race party with motivational speakers and workshops to help develop the ideas.	2019-09-10 17:04:39.587672

If historical projects could be searched this would ensure that companies have access to previous projects nearby which may allow them to gain access to data that would save considerable time or prevent embarassing situations where people are unaware of previous work at a site from the same division or another division.

Apps on handphone apps normally helps you to get from point to point and is able to tell when is the next bus arriving. However, there is nothing to help a person know where will the buses go to when it arrives. Not all people arriving at the bus stop knows where they are and thus the apps are useless when they want to go to the nearest rail station or nearest location they know.

At the same time, their curiosity and need for socializing increase by age. Therefore, a website where you can go online, pay small and give a call to someone to hear about her/his profession might work fine.<br>For example, the dead moments when one comes back from work or one is alone in an airport, can make a call and hear about renewable energy or traveling in Asia or latest news in physics or psychiatric area.

Flip through the pages like a real pad.\nOpen the pencil case to use your pencil, eraser, ruler, compass, protractor, scissors, highlighter, tape etc.\nPencil writes in cursive or type and uses different fonts. Grab eraser and pass it (double-clicked) over field to erase text. Pen and calligraphy pen also available.\nScissors work like real ones, they cut the line you choose. Tape the pieces with tape, or tape something else.\nCompass uses three clicking points: click the needle to drop it, click the dial to set distance and click the lead tip to draw.\nProtractors and rulers can be drawn on their line or to figure the distance.\nYou get the idea.

2979	/startup-idea/optimized-matches	When turn on the device, such as a stove with a matchstick , Approximately 20% of the matchstick burned and 80% of the matchstick will be thrown into the trash. This means that 80% of the wood used in the manufacture of matches will be thrown into the trash. Therefore 80% of wood of trees is wasted by people in the world. Our solution can be reduced Wood consumption About 50% ( in the industry matches) . Our plan is simple but intelligently , Imagine matchstick be on the two sides of incendiary material. What will happen then? The answer is simple: The matches used twice, First, on the one hand we use it, and then put into the box matches the next time you use it from the other side advantages: 1) matches consumption reduction of 50% 2) 50% reduction in cutting the wood of trees for the industry matches 3) Reducing waste matchstick the amount of 50% 4) Helping the environment 5) Matches can be sold at a higher price - Because the double use of Matches	2019-09-10 17:04:42.261218

2981	/startup-idea/decision-trees-for-tax-forms	Bureaucratic forms are a nightmare to fill-in yourself. There are lots of people who are required by law to submit them. In effect, this only creates thousands of hours wasted, plus large income for tax consultants. Every year, the same problems, same questions. Yet all this is unnecessary.. if so many people are filling in these documents each year, why isn't there already a website/service/tutorial how to fill them in correctly? Something where you don't need to read hundreds of pages of legislature. Imagine a website, where you go through a series of yes/no questions, then you are asked to fill in a couple of fields with instructions where you can find the correct value (there is always some other bureaucratic document which contains that value - such as annual tax recapitulation, confirmation of income etc.) And in the end you will get a correctly finished tax form, ready to print. I understand that especially with taxes there is no one-size-fits-all.. but come on, we've seen much more complicated tools than this. Besides, the tax advisors always know how to fill in the tax forms, this only aims to do it once, do it properly and finally DRY - don't repeat yourself.	2019-09-10 17:04:42.261218

2984	/startup-idea/stress-theory	Depending on the time or century people will suffer stress in a different way now to people that will live on the 31st century.\nChange has a unique way of changing people's behaviour to adapt to the environment. Examples of this include: technology, social changes, trends, environmental changes, belief changes. The fear of missing out makes humans extend their minds in a way that will suit and be accepted into society. Humans have stress because we are hard wired like that to achieve everything at once that is why the human mind can't cope and takes alot of time to process information. The mind is naturally made to survive and adapt a bit but with so many changes happening all the time. The mind can't keep up with itself leading your mind to release a stress hormone to adapt to the situation or if it's too hard it will simulate your body to not function properly resulting in fatigue and even in worst cases mental disordes. Stress is needed to get things done from getting up in the morning to reaching a major deadline in your job. Without stress, we wouldn't be able to cope with changing situations. Human motivation would just be elimated to any sort of work we do.	2019-09-10 17:04:43.744418
2985	/startup-idea/airporttaxi	I think Airport lift is expensive. In order to solve this problem, I think we can imagine a solution which develops a community. You have to go to the airport so you tell the application. It gives you a driver which brings you and then he got a credit for a future lift when he needs it. To avoid that people profit from the system, to enter the community people are forced to lift someone to the airport. And then begin an exchange of services between the community.	2019-09-10 17:04:43.744418
2986	/startup-idea/university-entrepreneurship-benchmarking	My idea is to develop a data drive platform where relational data on spinoffs emerging from the academic sector are systematically collected, discussed and analyzed. The collected data will be used to rank or benchmark each university within the European Union according sectors, number of spinoffs from 2000 to date. The relational data will also be used to construct a living social network analysis of the partnership network which will help shed light on the co-evolution of actors and the structure of the respective university networks.\nThis idea will appeal to venture capitalist who will find it easy to simply come to the platform to hunt for the next big spinoff to invest in. It also appeals to public officials who may use our data a tool to determine how each country University system is faring when it comes to creating new innovative companies. It will also appeal to innovation researchers who for the first time will have access to comparative data on University entrepreneurial activities. One important aspect of our data collection effort will be Crunch base which is one of the largest collections of startups, their founders, their funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs etc.\n	2019-09-10 17:04:43.744418

2991	/startup-idea/textbook-navigation	I have a vision that text books should use a "google map style" to present content. Because when I am reading something new in a branch of knowledge I am not familiar with I always find myself lost (where am I?) in the middle of the book forgetting where what I am reading right now belongs in the overall context. Maybe this is just how my brain works but I think that is common. So I would love to mouse wheel to zoom out and check where exactly I am. So the "street view" would be like opening the pdf file itself and read it normally. Instead of page up and down (like in a normal book) we should navigate like in a map (with several levels like street, neighborhood, cities, states, country etc). Each area size would correspond to the sun of pages of all pdf files inside that area. Of course we can think of features like marking "places" you have already visited, pre-requirements to understand some text could be seen as visa and so on. The author of a book instead of making a simple table of contents would make a map (in fact any reader would be able to make his interpretation of the book and create a map other user could use). I can detail.	2019-09-10 17:04:43.744418
2992	/startup-idea/community-class-action-facilitator	Allows members of the public with grievances against a company  to find and join forces with others who may have had the same issue with the same company in order to mount a class action where they would have been unable to take action on their own. It counters the ability of big business to short-change consumers because of the financial barriers to legal recourse. \nA user could search for a company and complaint type to find out whether other users have had the same complaint. The community would allow users to converse and provide guidance on mounting a class action. Law practices practices could offer their services, but at no stage is their financial co-ersion or is the ability of the users limited in controlling how to move forward. It is simply a way for aggrieved consumers who would otherwise not find others who have suffered the same injustice to find and join forces in a supportive and enpowering environment	2019-09-10 17:04:43.744418

If you could just remember half a sentence from a verse in a song, you should be able to search for that in an app that has hundred thousands of song lyrics in its Database. The app should have advanced search options, without making the app itself advanced. I know there are already apps like Soundhound and Shazam. But I think they are way too complicated and something easy as this is missing. It doesn't have to be fancy with lots of special functions, just that one thing that helps people find the songs that they've been looking for.

3041	/startup-idea/scoring-professsional-services-based-on-trust	Hello,\nI am from Brazil and here we have problems, for example, when we want to find a babysitter.  What we actually do, is going to mouth-to-mouth, asking friends if they know someone. If our friends trust in that professional(the babysitter for example), it is probably that I will trust too. The most important trait of a professional here in Brazil is the trust.\nSo i would like to make a network, that can connect professionals/services and score each of them based on a trust score. So if you hired a babbysitter and you are connected with me, then for me, this babysitter will have a high trust score. It is important to show, that this babysitter doest have a global trust score (like for example restaurants in Trip Advisor). It has a score relative too me.  So it is very difficul to fraud the score mechanism. \n\nDoes anyone know a similar service? feedback sugestions are welcome!\n	2019-09-10 17:04:48.798242

Worse still, money management apps are often unnecessarily complicated, requiring multiple data entries for one single instance of credit.\n\nSmartwatches happen to be highly visible, functional and simple for this purpose.

3076	/startup-idea/forte---a-musicians-social-network	Being a musician is very fun. Getting closer to the music and actually becomes a part of it, taking part in a creative process, showing people what you can do and sparks people to follow the beat… those are the privileges of being a musician. However, if you want to go deeper, being a musician is not easy in the cruel music industry. People want to hear a well-shaped performance. That is why a group of musicians gather and form music group, like bands or vocal group. Then, a question emerges: where to start?\n\nForte is a community-based social networking website which aims to help “solo flyers” in the musician’s world to ease them in forming a music group by connecting them to fellow musicians. Forte also provides information about music events and competitions to help amateur musicians to learn more about music and get coverage.\n\nFeatures:\n-Built-in social media platform for musicians\n-An extensive database of music-related events and competitions\n-Event-based challenges from Forte\n-High-quality articles about music\n-Collaboration with professional musicians and record labels via challenges, competitions, or courses	2019-09-10 17:04:51.825493
3077	/startup-idea/worldhelper	People waste time on things that they don't know the method to do. It may be things like searching for direction, having problems with homework, etc. If there was someone there that can be a real help, it would be great for the society.<br>I propose an app that helps to identify what trouble one is having  at that moment. As that individual posts his/her trouble, other WORLDhelper user will get notified. As difficulty of problem rises, it will also affect the amount of people who are willing to help. However, a difficult problem comes with a great compensation. Of course, the helper will get credited for their kindness and helpfulness. A failure is not an option so a helper must be sure that he or she can accomplish the problem to get credited.	2019-09-10 17:04:51.825493

3079	/startup-idea/website-to-reduce-training-research-time	I want to create a website to show the list of all the training institutes (and few other basic information), in a given location (using users geo location) based upon the search criteria. Idea is, to reduce the research time before taking a course. Today, if a professional wants to take any corporate training like PMP, CCNA, Six Sigma etc. they spend a lot of time researching questions like:\n-\tWhich institute would be best?\n-\tWhat are the batch timings?\n-\tIs there an option to do the training online?\n-\tCourse fee?\n-\tBatch size\n-\tDoes the institute have weekend batches?\n-\tHow far is the training institute?\n-\tEtc. etc.\nThis website is designed to provide all the basic and needed information on one single page before anyone decides to take a training. I have already initiated my work on this and it is 67% complete. I discussed this idea with a lot of people. I have not received much of negative feedback on this hence putting this here to get more views.	2019-09-10 17:04:51.825493
3080	/startup-idea/music-nodes	In South America, cultural events do not have much on-air time. Media is "dumbed-down" broadcasting reality shows and sensationalist news. Music, dance, art and, in general, the cultural agenda has been relegated to less than 1% of air-time and common people don't have access to the needed information. \n"Tambo: Culture Nodes" is a project that sets "Cultural ATM machines" spread in different key locations of a city. In this machines (nodes, connected to a central machine that updates the content) and through a tactile screen interface, users will be able to buy tickets for concerts, theaters, poetry recitals, etc., download songs, poems, drawings, etc. of local artists and also receive information regarding cultural events straight to their cellphone via bluetooth.\nIdle screens would show the nearest cultural event coming up.	2019-09-10 17:04:51.825493

3083	/startup-idea/road-dust-collector	Everyday dust accumulates along road side and it's pollutes air especially industrial town. Municipal authorities normally collects garbage from housing/shops/hotels. But they don't have any system to pick dust from road/highways. if a vehicle is designed to collect dust it's beneath/side when it moves on road, the dust will be removed during night or less busy hour. It may work like vacuum cleaner. This car clean vast areas along with near by cities with large metro. It can be designed to clean side footpath, concreted areas, parking lot, dusty places. Even it may also pick plastic/paper/other things simultaneously. The suction pump may be attached at bottom and both side of vehicle or something like that. Water sprinkler may also attached to the system to precipitate dust inside the vehicle.\nIf we want to get rid of air pollution we need to collect dust from road/highways/urban areas regularly and dispose them somewhere else.

3089	/startup-idea/quiz-through-ivr	A quiz backed with monetary prizes, available at all the time to all the people across geographies. The idea works like this: Quiz taker dials a toll free number in his free time (say 10 mins while s/he relaxes having tea!) and answers objective  questions after listening to it just by pressing the right number of the objective answer. If he answers all the questions right, then the said prize is given to him. For making money out of this concept, the quiz conductor has to run audio advertisements before and after the quiz session. The USP of this idea is that this can be attempted by people (of any language) who don't know how to write.

The problem I face is that you can't write on these books or else you get charged full MSRP for the book upon return. This comes to be a huge problem because, as you know, college students are faced with, on a daily basis, writing and taking notes in our books  I feel like this is a MAJOR reason why most people just buy the books brand new. I have an idea of a company that offers rental textbooks at a fraction of the MSRP cost and with see-through plastic sleeves embedded onto every page of the textbook for the students convenience of being able to write, doodle, highlight, draw, whatever their hearts desire within the textbooks. And upon return we will replace the sleeves with new ones and it'll be ready to go again	2019-09-10 17:04:53.549303
3096	/startup-idea/server-based-personal-computer	Due to my 18 month old son pulling and pushing everything in sight, I began to think of ways to protect my PC. The monitor was not a problem because all I had to do was push it against the wall and it was out of harms reach. \n The problem was the tower case. The size of the tower itself and the space needed for the fans to work properly, also all the cable that is necessary to run the computer made it a challenge. \n The best way I could think of was to store the tower inside a closet and connect the monitor wirelessly. But then I thought, 'if the monitor is being connected wirelessly to a tower, why not connect it directly to a server, wirelessly.'\n\n A monitor that connects to peripheral devices and runs on a OS that is located on a server. It can expand to tablets and phones or anywhere else you could think of that has internet connection. e.g. car, plane, train, etc.	2019-09-10 17:04:54.386355

3104	/startup-idea/movies-discount-session-app	Problem: Currently the movie theaters will play movies even if room is almost empty, which is not good for the business as the price they will spent to keep the session running is not worth it (of course  depending on the number of people you have in the session). On the other hand, you have people that really enjoy watch movies but don’t want to spend lot of money for every single movie they want to see it.\n\nSolution: Create an app that will “release” last minute seats from the movie theater in an affordable price, so as a customer you can be advised that a movie will start in 30 min for example and can pay a reduced price. It will be good for the business as they will play the movie anyway.\n\nIssues faced so far:\n- We need to have access to the room availability from different movie theaters and create a partnership with \nthem (mitigation: most of movie chains has an online system to pay tickets)\n- People that payed the ticket full price can feel in disadvantage (mitigation: we could allow only open and not market seats in this option).\n\n*IF YOU WANT TO BE PART OF THIS PROJECT PLEASE LET ME KNOW*\n\n	2019-09-10 17:04:54.386355

3121	/startup-idea/celebrity-property-market	Today, lots of people watch the celebrities and their private life. They want to know what they did on the last evening party or why did they break up with their boyfriend. They follow them on social sites like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. However, it struck me that so few of them actually met the celebrity they followed or somehow got into contact with them. For that reason, we decided to make a service (internet market), that would connect fans with celebrities by giving the fans an opportunity to buy/lease celebrity’s property (car, house, clothes…). But that’s not all, we want the connection to be more than just buying or sharing celebrity’s belongings. We want the connection to be much social, personal and so we will also offer a chance to order celebrity’s service. Examples of this could be: ordering Jennifer Lopez show on a birthday party or personally meet and dinner with Collin Farell. By this, the fans would gain some kind of personal access to celebrity’s life, that they would otherwise only read about on Facebook or Twitter. <br>All kind of feedbacks or comments would be appreciated!

3124	/startup-idea/flatmates-for-couples	In most metro cities, the rent of properties have sky rocketed. It is very difficult to find a decent place for living alone. So there is an increasing demand to share houses with other couples.  Idea is the create a web site which lists, flats for rent on shared basis. Each room can be rented out by 2 males/females or couples. The web site would handle to hassle of moving in, rent agreement, rent payment by itself.	2019-09-10 17:04:56.82981

3127	/startup-idea/third-party-library-upgrade-management-application	Most of the enterprise softwares usually depend/use many open-source/third-party libraries. At times, enterprises find bugs in those third-party libraries. When they raise the issues to the respective library owners, they realize that the issue had been already resolved and released in the later version!\n\nNow, even after knowing the version which contains the solution, it can not be used in production as it may create other issues/side effects of upgrading the library version. Whole system needs to be tested for verifying the product against the new library version, which is very painful and not so productive way given so many libraries and little time for such debugging/testing.\n\nIdea is that we can make a web application common for all the library providers where enterprises/users can go and look up the specific library version for the supported/compatible versions of other software packages/libraries.\n\nMoreover, enterprises can maintain metadata/profile about their current software stack (with specific version) and basis this information can get automatic notifications when library owners upgrades/releases a new version.	2019-09-10 17:04:56.82981
3128	/startup-idea/travel-scout	Ever had a situation where you went on a long drive to visit some tourist location just to find it far away from your expectation. Guess what your gas could be saved just by checking  Travel Scout. Travel Scout is designed so that you get to know the real deal. It would provide you with real time advice and information about all destinations.\nThe idea is to provide a platform where information about the available services, activities are all updated on a daily basis.  How you achieve this is by having certified advisers who could either be someone running a store nearby the location or a fellow tourist who has an interest to help others. \n\nWouldn't it help cherishing our weekends and holidays better!	2019-09-10 17:04:56.82981

3130	/startup-idea/relationship-app	I actually thought of an app which might make people interact with their smartphones on aspects of their relationship. The app is meant to be one that has a platform of a plant or a small garden which reflects the state of a relationship between lovers. For example, there will be button that says "morning kiss" and if you kissed your lover then you get to your app and press on that, the app waters the plant and it reflects a good state for the plant which reflects your relationship. The app would have more than that and the key is to be able to incorporate the statistics taken by the actions of the person to be reflected on the plant. The app will also need relationship counseling advises which would suggest to lovers what things to do to make the relationship reflect a beautiful state. \nThe idea would be criticized by those who think that this would make the relationship dwindle and make the lovers more focused on their phones than with their lovers, but this issue could be overcome easily and intelligently, by suggesting high points to those who stay away from their phones and spend time with their lovers for some time, and they get rewarded by that.	2019-09-10 17:04:56.82981

3132	/startup-idea/crowd-sourcing-marketplace-for-ic-chip-vendors	Presently, all the chip (Integrated circuits) customers relied on the chip vendor's FAE to provide technical support to use their chips correctly. However, the chip vendors alway support the 1st tier customer well, but less to other tiers. \nAnd, the chip vendors spending millions on CRM solutions to track design-ins but none of the CRM platform really "perform design-ins" but just a collaborative tracking & sales dashboard tool"\n\nMy idea is to have a platform: to let the customers list their "part number" that wanted to be supported, and on the other side, some engineers who had prior experiences on using that part number will engage and start with the design support process until achieving design-in/win. This could help the chip vendors to get more design wins on the untapped, lower tier customers without any more FAE resources. \nThe collaborative contents during the support process can be an asset to the chip vendors on how the document their datasheets/app notes in a more user-friendly way. Further, the platform also provides insights on application trends for the chip vendors to develop their next-gen products using machine learning.\n\n	2019-09-10 17:04:56.82981

If other users see heavy investing in a new post, a snowball of investing and interest will ensue.  If the content gains popularity, the backers that believed in it are rewarded with returns from a successful investment, and the content creator gets exposure.  If the content does not get views, the investment is lost.  The platform is meant to be a game of skill, incentivizing users to go out and find great content that isn't getting the views it deserves.\n \nThe first phase of the site will focus gaining a loyal userbase, and the best way to do that is to centralize the sharing of comedy.  Funny content of all mediums are being shared in a decentralized, stumble-upon fashion.  This platform is meant to set up a visual competition between content creators and between the people who share and find this content.  Top investors and consistently successful content creators will be listed.\n\nThe next phase moves into areas like books, blogs, podcasts, TV shows, movies, etc.	2019-09-10 17:04:56.82981

3148	/startup-idea/cuisine-fused-with-21st-century-literature	International cuisines have plagued the food industry in the Philippines. Filipino cuisine is seldom reinvented, leading to a small number of entrepreneurs venturing in this cuisine. It is the same situation for Filipino literary works because of the widespread of globalization and patronage towards foreign cuisine. This is not good news for the Filipino identity because it is being overshadowed by the foreign cuisines that millennial entrepreneurs have focused on. Calle 003 will bring Filipino cuisine and literary works together to kindle the millennial’s love and patronage towards their own culture. Calle 003 will reanimate how Filipinos see their culture since it is not a common thought to bring cuisine and literature together. As a concrete solution, Calle 003 will be adding relatable quotes from 21st Century literary works from the Philippines into its dish names, packaging designs and website. It is named Calle 003 because "calle" means street and millenial street parks are great locations to attract millennial customers. 003 represents the 3 main islands of the Philippines	2019-09-10 17:04:57.770682

3151	/startup-idea/technological-advances-for-basketball-courts	As a basketball fan, I have always considered the great difficulty faced by referees by the multiple types of calls: fouls, travelling, stepping on the different court lines...\n\nBecause of this, I was thinking if there would be any method to control those calls related to stepping on the line: turnovers on baseline/sidelines, backcourt violations, 3-second zone calls and any other similar calls that could be avoided with, for example, pressure sensors under the court. In this case, the signal would be processed and sent to the referees via watches, which would show directly the correct call and the player involved. It could be interesting to think about already-existing technologies like the falcon eye, which could also work in some way in this case.\n\nAs an extra idea, I found the possibility of combining this concept with the LED court: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2014/08/27/the-story-behind-nikes-basketball-court-that-lights-up-like-a-christmas-tree/	2019-09-10 17:04:57.770682

This is happening all over the country and the world.  The Harvard Business Review has found that 50% of meetings are a complete waste, and the other 50% take longer than they need to.  Why?  Because meetings aren't measured like money. \n\nThere have been attempts to try to fix this - but they all focus on trying to create better practices (to-do lists, goals for meetings, etc..)\n\nMy idea is different - it's a game that integrates with outlook, google calendar, and iCalendar to encourage people to schedule and attend less meetings through a point based reward system.\n\nLike golf, the lower score the better!  \n\nWe can never reduce all meetings, but a 10% or 25% reduction in meetings for companies means big increases in morale and performance.  \n	2019-09-10 17:04:59.298152

3156	/startup-idea/reviewing-platform---get-paid-for-writing-reviews	Pain : There's no platform available where app/website owners can have valid reviews from general public on their products. Play store or app store reviews are baseless. People can write anything there.  And paid review websites are too costly for small scale app/website owners (plus their reviews are obviously biased).\n\nSolution : Build a platform where app/website owners can get valid reviews on their products and reviewers will get some money for their reviews. \n\nOwners can post their apps/websites and set some questions which needs to be answered by the reviewers to maintain the authenticity of the reviews. The owners will set a max budget per review and the reviewers will get payment from that budget. \n\nThe owners can report a review if the review is baseless, irrelevant or biased. The website admins will constantly look over the reports and take necessary actions against the reviewer (or the owner). \n\nIn my knowledge, there is no similar platform available. Even if I am wrong, we can add some attractive features to make our platform better. \n\nIf u like this idea, u can contact me directly at shubhadeep.banerjee2011@yahoo.com .	2019-09-10 17:04:59.298152

3170	/startup-idea/connect-share-build-and-grow--csbg	It is a simple concept similar to a mutual fund, but quite different from it.I would like to call the organization CSBG, and will be used throughout in the description.The concept is simple -start with a group of people suppose 20-30 , these people would share 3 things in CSBG that is money, skills and time and that in minimal terms. Suppose these 20 people without leaving their existing work or job share 40 dollars a month, then the total amount will be 800 dollars in a month, now from these 20 people each will get an opportunity to submit a business plan and from the set of submissions highest voted business plan will be worked upon by these 20 people by sharing 1 or 2 hours daily, and the mutual amount would be invested into that business under a minimal interest rate of suppose 2 to 5 percent, plus 10 % of total profit to CSBG. Like this the network can be multiplied further under the rules and regulations of our organization CSBG. The pool of money will go on multiplying and can be used by members again for redevelopment of existing business at a minimal interest rate.	2019-09-10 17:05:00.226678

3172	/startup-idea/getting-rid-of-traffic-in-high-metropolitan-areas	Is there a simple way to beat bottle-neck traffic? Possibly. You tell me please.\nLet's say we all arrive to work at certain times base on the distance we are from our home to our office. Would that relieve the bottle-neck traffic jams we are seeing in highly congested areas? It doesn't matter where your work location is, rather, you would arrive at a certain time base on the commute distance from home to office. If you live 5 miles from work, then maybe you would arrive at 7:45 start time. If you lived 50+miles from work, you would have an arrival time of say 8:30. The "Flow" of the traffic would not encounter a bottle-neck like today, when everyone has to arrive at work at 8:00. Like pouring liquid out of a soda bottle. If you tip it upside down and try to get all of it to come out, you get a congestion at the narrowest part of the opening. But if you tilt the bottle slightly and allow just enough liquid to pour through without a congestion, then eventually all the liquid will flow freely from the bottle.	2019-09-10 17:05:00.226678

3183	/startup-idea/crowdfunding-platform-for-energy-projects	Situation: \nMany households and small businesses have thought about saving some money from their utility bills by installing a solar roof, or investing in a wind turbine, small dam, (Tesla) battery, etc. \nProblem:\nWhat restrains them from undertaking their projects may be one or more of the following factors: \n- risk on future savings/returns from their energy investment.\n- cost of financing: loans might require collateral or high interest payments, or the downpayment/initial investment is unaffordable.\nSolution:\nCrowdfunding platform designed for those interested in financing energy projects (that have an expected return in the form of surplus or savings). This would enable them to raise capital from their relatives, friends, neighbors, or other investors through donations or by selling equity of their projects, and/or debt at their favorable terms. The platform would then manage the monetary payments back to the investors of the project. Those would be based on the terms of the loan, and the calculation of the monetary value of electricity in the area where it is produced or accumulated (differential between daytime/nighttime value when batteries are involved) from the project.	2019-09-10 17:05:02.367261
3184	/startup-idea/caption-online-videos	I would like an app that allows users to grab an online video url, (consider youtube for starters) and sync the video with another online .srt file of any language. This app can be pretty useful considering the fact that many download online files illegally just to watch them with subtitles. It will only allow the user to watch one movie at a time, and then when the movie is over, no content is stored illegally. All we do is place a subtitle file on top of a video published online for the public. It would also be perfect if the movie could be directly connected to a casting device instead of a local playback ( which prevents users from screen capturing files that belong to others) and the user has control to a sync pad, where any discrepancies in subtitle sync could be adjusted with a timer.	2019-09-10 17:05:02.367261

Registered users allow automatically the access to gps. Active users are seen on a map. It means that one group sees only the second one.

3229	/startup-idea/profitability-based-public-sector-accounting	Because of austerity, Southern Europe has seen a dramatic lack of investment, giving rise to youth unemployment of close to 50% in a country such as Greece. Public sector investment is seen as impossible because public sector accounting completely focuses on a single point of measurement: deficit. In the private sector, no accountant would say that a company is badly run if it spends more money than it receives: it is probably simply investing. A similar approach should become common for governments.\n\nThe solution is simple: quantify the business case for public investments and judge them accordingly. In quite some cases, public investment, such as roads, railways, (renewable) energy, isolating buildings, etc., is actually profitable. In these cases, such spending should not be accounted as spending, but as investment and made possible by EU, rating agencies, investors, etc. In all cases, public sector spending should be judged not only on political merits, but also on expected financial returns, and the combination of the two is what should determite the final decision and also the credit worthyness of the state in question.	2019-09-10 17:05:06.488276

It should be possible to solely compare the new item against all the others and then be presented with the new updated list.\n\nOne should also be able to take a single item from an already completed list and be able to re-compare just that single item against the others in case one's opinion of it has changed.\n\n\nThere are several other features that would be 'nice to have' but the ones I have list above are the main.\n\n\nThanks for reading!   :)	2019-09-10 17:05:07.571558

3249	/startup-idea/create-opportunity-be-in-spotlight	Most of the organizations in this IT or Non IT industry create applications targeting end user/ entity. Sometime the application is huge and complex, so it takes a lot of time to identify the root cause to fix the issue.

On the other hand there is a significant problem with the traffic and so in many cases emergency can not reach the patient soon enough to save his/her life. But the solution I believe can work in this case is a portable system which can sent by autonomous drones to the patient and anyone near him/her will just need to put the chest device capable of monitoring the patient's EKG and applying appropriate electrical pulses and injecting appropriate drugs into the patient's body before the emergency crew reach to the scene. The process can easily be monitored and guided remotely by the emergency team. I thick the technology for this idea can be developed in the near future with enough funding	2019-09-10 17:05:11.580082

The users can have a voice conversations with the volunteers working on their learning language. People usually feels ashamed to express or talk any learning language with their friends or colleagues. So, in this app they can be free to communicate since there would be no one to judge them.

However I believe it would be better to have intelligent cameras which control the traffic lights based on traffic density (length & width of traffic in that Lane).  This can also control the next traffic light by sending the signals, more the density longer the traffic light. The data thus collected can be used for long term planning (like under/ over pass creation to decongest the bottleneck), mid term planning (like creating a separate path for 2 wheelers) which can stream line the traffic flow	2019-09-10 17:05:11.580082

This apps will integrate between Customer, Fabric store/ craftsman, designer, and tailor into one ecosystem. Customer can choose whether they want to buy only fabric / model / ready to use dress. Designer can browse fabric / buy fabric / posting their design to be bought by customer. Fabric store can more fabric as  raw or has been tailored into dress and tailor can get more order by posting their work and place to be reach by either designer or customer. This solution also can be applied to shoes or bag.	2019-09-10 17:05:11.580082

3305	/startup-idea/chatbot-for-in-resto-ordering	Restaurants/Pubs/Bars, besides their outlandish decor, still come with those 100 years old menu cards, listing dishes that you may not be familiar with. We normally tend to give a blank look when we can’t figure out what we really want to eat. And very often, end up ordering dishes that we never intended to order, or may keep ordering the same dish, simply because we don’t know what a particular dish looks like. On top of it imagine being in a loud bar and the waiter not being able to understand what you like to order. Or, he feels like he has understood the order correctly but then brings in a dish whose name rhymes with the one you were trying to order. Meallion solves each and every issue with your interaction with the restaurant without letting users download the app. Be it researching for the perfect food item you wanna order, be it calling the waiter for water, napkins or be it paying/splitting the bill, in the end, everything can be done seamlessly with this chatbot.	2019-09-10 17:05:11.580082
3306	/startup-idea/collaborative-platform-to-share-tech-dev-cost	Unless you are building unique tech the chances are you are developing( paying someone) something that probably large number of people around the world are doing the same thing.\nYou are on limited budget, you are wasting time on making decisions, what features to implement , going back and forth with dev = wasting money. You hired some cheap dev with no good skills = you end up with crappy product or no product at all= your idea/company dies. \nWhy  not join budget with people who need ( almost) the same platform. Imagine 20 people who act as one team when comes to developing tech and at the same time you run your own operations in your country. Everyone wins!\nSo.. proposal is to build collaborative platform where teams( with the same business can work on tech process. hire rock star devs and keep building individual companies at the same time. It does not stop at tech only. Share strategies , feedback etc that collectively will help everyone to succeed. \nThis idea came from my own frustration  with not being able to move my existing startup forward because of luck of resources ( money) to develop good, solid tech that really is align with business model/operations.	2019-09-10 17:05:12.53016
3307	/startup-idea/let%e2%80%99s-join-hands-	This platform would work similar to crowdfunding but with it’s own style and features . Each user would invest 10 dollars minimum monthly like a netflix subscription , 10 dollars = 1 vote . By sharing , word of mouth , online and ground marketing we will grow our userbase(investors) more and more everyday . The idea is to atleast have 1000 to 100,000’s  of little investors  . I call them investors because everyone is a partner on this platform . When people invest a small amount ( like 10 dollars ) on other platforms then they hold no position to vote or have a say or even be part of that startup company . It’s like dropping a bucket of water in an ocean . But with our platform each user(investor) get’s to be in the game rather than on the bench . So for example let’s say Mark came up with a project called “ CityonCloud “ into our platform . First he uploads a short explainer video describing his service and then below it he will post details about his team and their background . Each investors gets to vote on whether we should invest or not to invest in this project .	2019-09-10 17:05:12.53016

Our robot will dust and mop your house for you while you are at work or when you want to relax. Our robot is fully automatic. It undocks from the charger on its own and starts cleaning the house. When it's done it automatically docks back on to the charger to recharge itself. In today's market, a good robot with similar features will cost you around $600, but we have made the robot with almost the same features at a very cheap price. We also can add a self-cleaning charger, when the robot comes and docks for charging, all the dust and water, it empties on its own, so you don't have to think about vacuuming for weeks.

3345	/startup-idea/manual-exposure-panorama	Iphone exposure lock system has never worked correctly for their panorama camera option. Their design flaw is to have you touch the screen to lock exposure on a position on the screen frame,moving the camera will undoubtedly will find different brightness values for that screen position as we pan. The App should let you choose a brightness value,lock that exposure information in for the entire panorama shot regardless where you point the camera through the pan. This ruins wide panorama shots as vertically the whole section of the image goes dark as the camera passes over a brighter section of sky or landscape. As it is iPhone's exposure lock is still auto reading for that screen area. We need just lock exposure settings until the panorama shot has been completed.	2019-09-10 17:05:14.8354

In addition using laser focusing techniques we can burn the damaged blood vessels as a temporary fix from the top of skin without cutting the body invasively. Anyway this technology may be not mature enough for a real world product but I think it is a promising solution for this problem and saving the people's lives	2019-09-10 17:05:14.8354
3348	/startup-idea/cost-effective-business-communication-solutions	There is a promising channel of communication which offers cost-effective business communication solutions. It offers real time information dispersal which most companies are aiming with little or no limitations. A mass texting service promises the most efficient communication so you can say good bye to long emails and calls. A text message is simple, concise and clear. It offers convenience to both sender and receiver. 98 out of 100 people read the message within 15 minutes which shows how powerful this channel is. Spam is out of the question thanks to constant monitoring from governing bodies so this builds consumer confidence.

3352	/startup-idea/synchronized-brakes	Synchronizing brakes in vehicles on highways in particular is beneficial in regards to traffic safety. <br><br>Many accidents happens on highway because of drivers losing control of their vehicles, egotistic driving habits and being unable to brake in time. The latter is due to the response time from our brain to notice the accident or the other driving ahead of them, to the foot stepping on the brakes.<br><br>Synchronized brakes is a inter/intraconnection module connected to the brakes and the drivers behind you. This of course only functions if both or more drivers have this device. When the first driver notices an accident or traffic jams ahead, they will be the first to respond and instead of a delayed response from drivers behind them, this device will connect to the other drivers in a lane and when they are within a certain distance, it will activate the brakes if the driver ahead brakes. <br><br>This device is intended to reduce collision on highway due to distracted drivers or/and delayed reaction.<br><br>There are some ethical matters to address and some issues like unnecesary and excessive braking which allows the device to become a hassle and or a harassment.

The automatisation leads to extinction of most of jobs, but same time to the over-productive manufacturing of goods. Money belong to the country, and people have special accounts in the country's database. The production of the country gives it income as the products are sold outside, so the money are mostly spent on the inventions and re-equipement (for the mechanisation of works), and the rest is left for the people. Every person gets as much money as the rest of the budget allows - what's left is equally spread among the registered owners of the Social Financial Accounts.	2019-09-10 17:05:17.038811

Product samples are provided to customers and the method of sending the products to the customers who will use that is challenging and more expensive. Currently, most of the companies provide free samples to people without knowing their demographics, psychographics or consumption details.\nSolution:\nIt is good to start a website where customers can order the samples by paying a very minimal amount. i.e, shipping cost or for free of cost. This business should have a tie-up with the companies that have the newly launched products or the companies which need to provide trials. The products are available to people based on geographical restrictions. example limited to only the cities that are targeted by the manufacturing company. Restricting to 5 pieces makes the customers curate the products based on their need.

3388	/startup-idea/grade-time	For teachers: Teaching faculty spend a great amount of time grading papers and writing (or typing) comments about students' work to help them improve. Many times the comments fall in general categories and are repeated over and over when grading for an entire class. For example, "you need more details here", "Confusing choice of words",  "I like this section, part, answer." etc. Teachers could use a way to save time writing the same thing on multiple papers. This is what I propose for teachers at all levels.\n\nAn app or utility that can hover over assignments submitted online that stores commonly used feedback phrases (in the instructor's own words or style) that can be selected and inserted on the students paper as text or handwriting. The teacher would enter the 20 or so comments in the app and as he/she reads the paper taps the appropriate comment and it is inserted (above, beside or in the margin) of the student's assignment.\nI know very little about software development but this seems like something that could be designed rather easily.

3390	/startup-idea/interest-for-life	The model of this charity is to have a 'base account' and any donations to Interest for Love would contribute to this base account. Any interest earned off of this base account would then go towards the project. Money would not be earned on interest only from donnors since all interest will be going into funding the projects which 'interest for love' would support financially. Inner workings of interest for love would operate very much like a money managing company in that they would be investing to create the most interest off of the base, which would grow every year through donations. The idea started in my head when I was thinking about how to fix the US health care system and if I were to win the lottery I would set up a base account and any interest earned from the base account would then go towards supporting free mental health care for veterans. As interest on the base grows this would eventually cover all health care costs and include other people such as those who served in the peace core, and those peoples children. I would love to donate to a charity that is structured this way since it is sustainable and smart.	2019-09-10 17:05:18.805696
